Prior to versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, and 4.0.4, attempting to parse a patch whose filename headers contain the line break characters `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029` can cause the `parsePatch` method to enter an infinite loop. It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running out of memory. Applications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed). The `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected. Finally, a second and lesser interdependent bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its \"leading garbage\"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse. Versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, and 4.0.4 contain a fix.

The OF path, which uses of_find_net_device_by_node(), never releases\n   the elevated refcount on the conduit's kobject. Nominally, the OF and\n   non-OF paths should result in objects having identical reference\n   counts taken, and it is already suspicious that\n   dsa_dev_to_net_device() has a put_device() call which is missing in\n   dsa_port_parse_of(), but we can actually even verify that an issue\n   exists. With CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE=y, if we run this command\n   \"before\" and \"after\" applying this patch:\n\n(unbind the conduit driver for net device eno2)\necho 0000:00:00.2 > \/sys\/bus\/pci\/drivers\/fsl_enetc\/unbind\n\nwe see these lines in the output diff which appear only with the patch\napplied:\n\nkobject: 'eno2' (ffff002009a3a6b8): kobject_release, parent 0000000000000000 (delayed 1000)\nkobject: '109' (ffff0020099d59a0): kobject_release, parent 0000000000000000 (delayed 1000)\n\n2. After we find the conduit interface one way (OF) or another (non-OF),\n   it can get unregistered at any time, and DSA remains with a long-lived,\n   but in this case stale, cpu_dp->conduit pointer. Holding the net\n   device's underlying kobject isn't actually of much help, it just\n   prevents it from being freed (but we never need that kobject\n   directly). What helps us to prevent the net device from being\n   unregistered is the parallel netdev reference mechanism (dev_hold()\n   and dev_put()).\n\nActually we actually use that netdev tracker mechanism implicitly on\nuser ports since commit 2f1e8ea726e9 (\"net: dsa: link interfaces with\nthe DSA master to get rid of lockdep warnings\"), via netdev_upper_dev_link().\nBut time still passes at DSA switch probe time between the initial\nof_find_net_device_by_node() code and the user port creation time, time\nduring which the conduit could unregister itself and DSA wouldn't know\nabout it.\n\nSo we have to run of_find_net_device_by_node() under rtnl_lock() to\nprevent that from happening, and release the lock only with the netdev\ntracker having acquired the reference.\n\nDo we need to keep the reference until dsa_unregister_switch() \/\ndsa_switch_shutdown()?\n1: Maybe yes. A switch device will still be registered even if all user\n   ports failed to probe, see commit 86f8b1c01a0a (\"net: dsa: Do not\n   make user port errors fatal\"), and the cpu_dp->conduit pointers\n   remain valid.  I haven't audited all call paths to see whether they\n   will actually use the conduit in lack of any user port, but if they\n   do, it seems safer to not rely on user ports for that reference.\n2. Definitely yes. We support changing the conduit which a user port is\n   associated to, and we can get into a situation where we've moved all\n   user ports away from a conduit, thus no longer hold any reference to\n   it via the net device tracker. But we shouldn't let it go nonetheless\n   - see the next change in relation to dsa_tree_find_first_conduit()\n   and LAG conduits which disappear.\n   We have to be prepared to return to the physical conduit, so the CPU\n   port must explicitly keep another reference to it.

Accordingly, the code transfers\ntruesize from the parent to the newly created segments.\n\nPrior to commit ed4cccef64c1 (\"gro: fix ownership transfer\"), this\ntruesize subtraction in skb_segment_list() was valid because fragments\nstill carry a reference to the original socket.\n\nHowever, commit ed4cccef64c1 (\"gro: fix ownership transfer\") changed\nthis behavior by ensuring that fraglist entries are explicitly\norphaned (skb->sk = NULL) to prevent illegal orphaning later in the\nstack. This change meant that the entire socket memory charge remained\nwith the head SKB, but the corresponding accounting logic in\nskb_segment_list() was never updated.\n\nAs a result, the current code unconditionally adds each fragment's\ntruesize to delta_truesize and subtracts it from the parent SKB. Since\nthe fragments are no longer charged to the socket, this subtraction\nresults in an effective under-count of memory when the head is freed.\nThis causes sk_wmem_alloc to remain non-zero, preventing socket\ndestruction and leading to a persistent memory leak.\n\nThe leak can be observed via KMEMLEAK when tearing down the networking\nenvironment:\n\nunreferenced object 0xffff8881e6eb9100 (size 2048):\n  comm \"ping\", pid 6720, jiffies 4295492526\n  backtrace:\n    kmem_cache_alloc_noprof+0x5c6\/0x800\n    sk_prot_alloc+0x5b\/0x220\n    sk_alloc+0x35\/0xa00\n    inet6_create.part.0+0x303\/0x10d0\n    __sock_create+0x248\/0x640\n    __sys_socket+0x11b\/0x1d0\n\nSince skb_segment_list() is exclusively used for SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST\npackets constructed by GRO, the truesize adjustment is removed.\n\nThe call to skb_release_head_state() must be preserved.
