An **Improper URL Handling Vulnerability** allows an attacker to access sensitive local files on the server by exploiting the `file:\/\/\/` protocol. This vulnerability is triggered via the **\"real-browser\"** request type, which takes a screenshot of the URL provided by the attacker. By supplying local file paths, such as `file:\/\/\/etc\/passwd`, an attacker can read sensitive data from the server. This vulnerability arises because the system does not properly validate or sanitize the user input for the URL field. Specifically: 1. The URL input (`<input data-v-5f5c86d7=\"\" id=\"url\" type=\"url\" class=\"form-control\" pattern=\"https?:\/\/.+\" required=\"\">`) allows users to input arbitrary file paths, including those using the `file:\/\/\/` protocol, without server-side validation. 2. The server then uses the user-provided URL to make a request, passing it to a browser instance that performs the \"real-browser\" request, which takes a screenshot of the content at the given URL. If a local file path is entered (e.g., `file:\/\/\/etc\/passwd`), the browser fetches and captures the file’s content. Since the user input is not validated, an attacker can manipulate the URL to request local files (e.g., `file:\/\/\/etc\/passwd`), and the system will capture a screenshot of the file's content, potentially exposing sensitive data. Any **authenticated user** who can submit a URL in \"real-browser\" mode is at risk of exposing sensitive data through screenshots of these files.
