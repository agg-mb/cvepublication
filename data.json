The program returns struct xdp_md's\negress_ifindex, and the latter is only allowed to be accessed under mentioned\nexpected_attach_type. progB is then inserted into the tailcall which progA\ncalls.\n\nThe underlying issue goes beyond XDP though. Another example are programs\nof type BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR. sock_addr_is_valid_access() as well\nas sock_addr_func_proto() have different logic depending on the programs'\nexpected_attach_type.

Fix it by enforcing\nexpected_attach_type in __bpf_prog_map_compatible().\n\nNote that we only enforce this for tailcall maps, but not for BPF devmaps or\ncpumaps: There, the programs are invoked through dev_map_bpf_prog_run*() and\ncpu_map_bpf_prog_run*() which set up a new environment \/ context and therefore\nthese situations are not prone to this issue."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/08cb3dc9d2b44f153d0bcf2cb966e4a94b5d0f32","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/4540aed51b12bc13364149bf95f6ecef013197c0","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/a99de19128aec0913f3d529f529fbbff5edfaff8","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/c1ad19b5d8e23123503dcaf2d4342e1b90b923ad","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/f856c598080ba7ce1252867b8ecd6ad5bdaf9a6a","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-40124","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-11-12T11:15:41.920","lastModified":"2025-11-12T16:19:12.850","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsparc: fix accurate exception reporting in copy_{from_to}_user for UltraSPARC III\n\nAnthony Yznaga tracked down that a BUG_ON in ext4 code with large folios\nenabled resulted from copy_from_user() returning impossibly large values\ngreater than the size to be copied.

Top level BPF_EXIT is reached. Such instructions are never a part of\n   an SCC, so compute_scc_callchain() in maybe_scc_exit() will return\n   false, and maybe_scc_exit() will return early.\nc. A checkpoint is reached and matched. Checkpoints are created by\n   is_state_visited(), which calls maybe_enter_scc(), which allocates\n   bpf_scc_visit instances for checkpoints within SCCs.\n\nHence, for non-speculative symbolic execution paths, the assumption\nstill holds: if maybe_scc_exit() is called for a state within an SCC,\nbpf_scc_visit instance must exist.\n\nThis patch removes the verifier_bug() call for speculative paths."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/3861e7c4324aa20a632fb74eb3904114f6afdb57","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/a3c73d629ea1373af3c0c954d41fd1af555492e3","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-40144","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-11-12T11:15:44.237","lastModified":"2025-11-12T16:19:12.850","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnvdimm: ndtest: Return -ENOMEM if devm_kcalloc() fails in ndtest_probe()\n\ndevm_kcalloc() may fail. ndtest_probe() allocates three DMA address\narrays (dcr_dma, label_dma, dimm_dma) and later unconditionally uses\nthem in ndtest_nvdimm_init(), which can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference under low-memory conditions.\n\nCheck all three allocations and return -ENOMEM if any allocation fails,\njumping to the common error path.

The vulnerability exists in both CUPS-Filters 1.x and the successor library libcupsfilters (CUPS-Filters 2.x). In CUPS-Filters 2.x, the vulnerable function is `_cfImageReadTIFF() in libcupsfilters`. When this function is invoked as part of `cfFilterImageToRaster()`, the caller passes a look-up-table during whose processing the out of bounds memory access happens. In CUPS-Filters 1.x, the equivalent functions are all found in the cups-filters repository, which is not split into subprojects yet, and the vulnerable code is in `_cupsImageReadTIFF()`, which is called through `cupsImageOpen()` from the `imagetoraster` tool. A patch is available in commit b69dfacec7f176281782e2f7ac44f04bf9633cfa."}],"metrics":{"cvssMetricV31":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","cvssData":{"version":"3.1","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1\/AV:A\/AC:H\/PR:L\/UI:N\/S:U\/C:L\/I:L\/A:N","baseScore":3.7,"baseSeverity":"LOW","attackVector":"ADJACENT_NETWORK","attackComplexity":"HIGH","privilegesRequired":"LOW","userInteraction":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"LOW","integrityImpact":"LOW","availabilityImpact":"NONE"},"exploitabilityScore":1.2,"impactScore":2.5}]},"weaknesses":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary","description":[{"lang":"en","value":"CWE-125"},{"lang":"en","value":"CWE-787"}]}],"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/OpenPrinting\/cups-filters\/blob\/3c58463e341b12c9d30d7d3807d2bac1bc595a78\/cupsfilters\/image-tiff.c#L34","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/OpenPrinting\/cups-filters\/blob\/3c58463e341b12c9d30d7d3807d2bac1bc595a78\/filter\/imagetoraster.c#L613","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/OpenPrinting\/libcupsfilters\/blob\/33421982e10f6a14bc0bab03b80c9cf4660e8d7d\/cupsfilters\/image-tiff.c#L32","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/OpenPrinting\/libcupsfilters\/commit\/b69dfacec7f176281782e2f7ac44f04bf9633cfa","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/OpenPrinting\/libcupsfilters\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-jpxg-qc2c-hgv4","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"http:\/\/www.openwall.com\/lists\/oss-security\/2025\/11\/12\/1","source":"af854a3a-2127-422b-91ae-364da2661108"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-60646","sourceIdentifier":"cve@mitre.org","published":"2025-11-12T19:15:37.013","lastModified":"2025-11-12T22:15:49.007","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) in the Business Line Management module of Xxl-api v1.3.0 attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via injecting a crafted payload into the Name parameter."}],"metrics":{"cvssMetricV31":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","cvssData":{"version":"3.1","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1\/AV:N\/AC:L\/PR:N\/UI:R\/S:C\/C:L\/I:L\/A:N","baseScore":6.1,"baseSeverity":"MEDIUM","attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","privilegesRequired":"NONE","userInteraction":"REQUIRED","scope":"CHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"LOW","integrityImpact":"LOW","availabilityImpact":"NONE"},"exploitabilityScore":2.8,"impactScore":2.7}]},"weaknesses":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","description":[{"lang":"en","value":"CWE-79"}]}],"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/LockeTom\/0a02c0b2e2011abfbdf4e5fdbcc9b371","source":"cve@mitre.org"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/xuxueli\/xxl-api\/issues\/65","source":"cve@mitre.org"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-61667","sourceIdentifier":"security-advisories@github.com","published":"2025-11-12T19:15:37.193","lastModified":"2025-11-12T19:15:37.193","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"The Datadog Agent collects events and metrics from hosts and sends them to Datadog.

A vulnerability was identified in the `evervault-go` SDK’s attestation verification logic in versions of `evervault-go` prior to 1.3.2 that may allow incomplete documents to pass validation. This may cause the client to trust an enclave operator that does not meet expected integrity guarantees. The exploitability of this issue is limited in Evervault-hosted environments as an attacker would require the pre-requisite ability to serve requests from specific evervault domain names, following from our ACME challenge based TLS certificate acquisition pipeline. The vulnerability primarily affects applications which only check PCR8. Though the efficacy is also reduced for applications that check all PCR values, the impact is largely remediated by checking PCR 0, 1 and 2. The identified issue has been addressed in version 1.3.2 by validating attestation documents before storing in the cache, and replacing the naive equality checks with a new SatisfiedBy check. Those who useevervault-go to attest Enclaves that are hosted outside of Evervault environments and cannot upgrade have two possible workarounds available. Modify the application logic to fail verification if PCR8 is not explicitly present and non-empty and\/or add custom pre-validation to reject documents that omit any required PCRs."}],"metrics":{"cvssMetricV31":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","cvssData":{"version":"3.1","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1\/AV:N\/AC:L\/PR:H\/UI:N\/S:C\/C:H\/I:H\/A:N","baseScore":8.7,"baseSeverity":"HIGH","attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","privilegesRequired":"HIGH","userInteraction":"NONE","scope":"CHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","integrityImpact":"HIGH","availabilityImpact":"NONE"},"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.8}]},"weaknesses":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary","description":[{"lang":"en","value":"CWE-347"}]}],"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/evervault\/evervault-go\/commit\/7c824d289bba11ec0bea46a338023f5b128bbb28","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/evervault\/evervault-go\/pull\/48","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/evervault\/evervault-go\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-88h9-77c7-p6w4","source":"security-advisories@github.com"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2011-10034","sourceIdentifier":"disclosure@vulncheck.com","published":"2025-11-12T22:15:40.533","lastModified":"2025-11-12T22:15:40.533","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"AUTOMGEN versions up to and including 8.0.0.7 (also referenced as 8.022) contain a vulnerability in that project file handling frees an object and subsequently dereferences the stale pointer when processing certain malformed fields.

ACPI enumeration includes a Memory32Fixed entry, and\noptionally a SystemMemory descriptor for an OperationRegion, e.g. if the\ndevice needs to be accessed via a Control Method.\n\nIf a SystemMemory entry is present, then the kernel's ACPI driver will\nauto-ioremap the region so that it can be accessed at will.  However, the\nACPI spec doesn't provide a way to enumerate the memory type of\nSystemMemory regions, i.e. there's no way to tell software that a region\nmust be mapped as UC vs. WB, etc.  As a result, Linux's ACPI driver always\nmaps SystemMemory regions using ioremap_cache(), i.e. as WB on x86.\n\nThe dedicated device drivers however, e.g. the HPET driver and TPM driver,\nwant to map their associated memory as UC or WC, as accessing PCI devices\nusing WB is unsupported.\n\nOn bare metal and non-CoCO, the conflicting requirements \"work\" as firmware\nconfigures the PCI hole (and other device memory) to be UC in the MTRRs.\nSo even though the ACPI mappings request WB, they are forced to UC- in the\nkernel's tracking due to the kernel properly handling the MTRR overrides,\nand thus are compatible with the drivers' requested WC\/UC-.\n\nWith force WB MTRRs on SNP and TDX guests, the ACPI mappings get their\nrequested WB if the ACPI mappings are established before the dedicated\ndriver code attempts to initialize the device.  E.g. if acpi_init()\nruns before the corresponding device driver is probed, ACPI's WB mapping\nwill \"win\", and result in the driver's ioremap() failing because the\nexisting WB mapping isn't compatible with the requested WC\/UC-.\n\nE.g. when a TPM is emulated by the hypervisor (ignoring the security\nimplications of relying on what is allegedly an untrusted entity to store\nmeasurements), the TPM driver will request UC and fail:\n\n  [  1.730459] ioremap error for 0xfed40000-0xfed45000, requested 0x2, got 0x0\n  [  1.732780] tpm_tis MSFT0101:00: probe with driver tpm_tis failed with error -12\n\nNote, the '0x2' and '0x0' values refer to \"enum page_cache_mode\", not x86's\nmemtypes (which frustratingly are an almost pure inversion; 2 == WB, 0 == UC).\nE.g. tracing mapping requests for TPM TIS yields:\n\n Mapping TPM TIS with req_type = 0\n WARNING: CPU: 22 PID: 1 at arch\/x86\/mm\/pat\/memtype.c:530 memtype_reserve+0x2ab\/0x460\n Modules linked in:\n CPU: 22 UID: 0 PID: 1 Comm: swapper\/0 Tainted: G        W           6.16.0-rc7+ #2 VOLUNTARY\n Tainted: [W]=WARN\n Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine\/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 05\/29\/2025\n RIP: 0010:memtype_reserve+0x2ab\/0x460\n  __ioremap_caller+0x16d\/0x3d0\n  ioremap_cache+0x17\/0x30\n  x86_acpi_os_ioremap+0xe\/0x20\n  acpi_os_map_iomem+0x1f3\/0x240\n  acpi_os_map_memory+0xe\/0x20\n  acpi_ex_system_memory_space_handler+0x273\/0x440\n  acpi_ev_address_space_dispatch+0x176\/0x4c0\n  acpi_ex_access_region+0x2ad\/0x530\n  acpi_ex_field_datum_io+0xa2\/0x4f0\n  acpi_ex_extract_from_field+0x296\/0x3e0\n  acpi_ex_read_data_from_field+0xd1\/0x460\n  acpi_ex_resolve_node_to_value+0x2ee\/0x530\n  acpi_ex_resolve_to_value+0x1f2\/0x540\n  acpi_ds_evaluate_name_path+0x11b\/0x190\n  acpi_ds_exec_end_op+0x456\/0x960\n  acpi_ps_parse_loop+0x27a\/0xa50\n  acpi_ps_parse_aml+0x226\/0x600\n  acpi_ps_execute_method+0x172\/0x3e0\n  acpi_ns_evaluate+0x175\/0x5f0\n  acpi_evaluate_object+0x213\/0x490\n  acpi_evaluate_integer+0x6d\/0x140\n  acpi_bus_get_status+0x93\/0x150\n  acpi_add_single_object+0x43a\/0x7c0\n  acpi_bus_check_add+0x149\/0x3a0\n  acpi_bus_check_add_1+0x16\/0x30\n  acpi_ns_walk_namespace+0x22c\/0x360\n  acpi_walk_namespace+0x15c\/0x170\n  acpi_bus_scan+0x1dd\/0x200\n  acpi_scan_init+0xe5\/0x2b0\n  acpi_init+0x264\/0x5b0\n  do_one_i\n---truncated---"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/0dccbc75e18df85399a71933d60b97494110f559","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/34ff466f74d0fe1db8956f9c245e2bb2c67f67bf","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/91ab8a21bda2d2d2842b6159ac060d9100433a3c","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-40182","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-11-12T22:15:44.963","lastModified":"2025-11-12T22:15:44.963","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncrypto: skcipher - Fix reqsize handling\n\nCommit afddce13ce81d (\"crypto: api - Add reqsize to crypto_alg\")\nintroduced cra_reqsize field in crypto_alg struct to replace type\nspecific reqsize fields.

[2]\n\nAdd proper set_reqsize calls in the skcipher init function to\nproperly initialize reqsize for these algorithms in the framework.\n\n[1]: https:\/\/lore.kernel.org\/linux-crypto\/aCL8BxpHr5OpT04k@gondor.apana.org.au\/\n[2]: https:\/\/gist.github.com\/Pratham-T\/24247446f1faf4b7843e4014d5089f6b"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/229c586b5e86979badb7cb0d38717b88a9e95ddd","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/f041339d6b9a5a46437f0c48fc7279c92af7a513","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-40183","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-11-12T22:15:45.080","lastModified":"2025-11-12T22:15:45.080","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Fix metadata_dst leak __bpf_redirect_neigh_v{4,6}\n\nCilium has a BPF egress gateway feature which forces outgoing K8s Pod\ntraffic to pass through dedicated egress gateways which then SNAT the\ntraffic in order to interact with stable IPs outside the cluster.\n\nThe traffic is directed to the gateway via vxlan tunnel in collect md\nmode.

DuckDB implemented block-based encryption of DB on the filesystem starting with DuckDB 1.4.0. There are a few issues related to this implementation. The DuckDB can fall back to an insecure random number generator (pcg32) to generate cryptographic keys or IVs. When clearing keys from memory, the compiler may remove the memset() and leave sensitive data on the heap. By modifying the database header, an attacker could downgrade the encryption mode from GCM to CTR to bypass integrity checks. There may be a failure to check return value on call to OpenSSL `rand_bytes()`. An attacker could use public IVs to compromise the internal state of RNG and determine the randomly generated key used to encrypt temporary files, get access to cryptographic keys if they have access to process memory (e.g. through memory leak),circumvent GCM integrity checks, and\/or influence the OpenSSL random number generator and DuckDB would not be able to detect a failure of the generator. Version 1.4.2 has disabled the insecure random number generator by no longer using the fallback to write to or create databases. Instead, DuckDB will now attempt to install and load the OpenSSL implementation in the `httpfs` extension. DuckDB now uses secure MbedTLS primitive to clear memory as recommended and requires explicit specification of ciphers without integrity checks like CTR on `ATTACH`. Additionally, DuckDB now checks the return code."}],"metrics":{"cvssMetricV40":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","cvssData":{"version":"4.0","vectorString":"CVSS:4.0\/AV:N\/AC:L\/AT:N\/PR:N\/UI:N\/VC:L\/VI:L\/VA:N\/SC:N\/SI:N\/SA:N\/E:X\/CR:X\/IR:X\/AR:X\/MAV:X\/MAC:X\/MAT:X\/MPR:X\/MUI:X\/MVC:X\/MVI:X\/MVA:X\/MSC:X\/MSI:X\/MSA:X\/S:X\/AU:X\/R:X\/V:X\/RE:X\/U:X","baseScore":6.9,"baseSeverity":"MEDIUM","attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","attackRequirements":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"NONE","userInteraction":"NONE","vulnConfidentialityImpact":"LOW","vulnIntegrityImpact":"LOW","vulnAvailabilityImpact":"NONE","subConfidentialityImpact":"NONE","subIntegrityImpact":"NONE","subAvailabilityImpact":"NONE","exploitMaturity":"NOT_DEFINED","confidentialityRequirement":"NOT_DEFINED","integrityRequirement":"NOT_DEFINED","availabilityRequirement":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedAttackVector":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedAttackComplexity":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedAttackRequirements":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedUserInteraction":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedSubIntegrityImpact":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact":"NOT_DEFINED","Safety":"NOT_DEFINED","Automatable":"NOT_DEFINED","Recovery":"NOT_DEFINED","valueDensity":"NOT_DEFINED","vulnerabilityResponseEffort":"NOT_DEFINED","providerUrgency":"NOT_DEFINED"}}]},"weaknesses":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary","description":[{"lang":"en","value":"CWE-327"}]}],"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/duckdb.org\/2025\/09\/16\/announcing-duckdb-140.html","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/duckdb\/duckdb\/blob\/029a5b87ff5b1cd22f7f9717d48cd8830d00807c\/src\/common\/random_engine.cpp#L20","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/duckdb\/duckdb\/pull\/17275","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/duckdb\/duckdb\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-vmp8-hg63-v2hp","source":"security-advisories@github.com"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-64482","sourceIdentifier":"security-advisories@github.com","published":"2025-11-12T22:15:49.970","lastModified":"2025-11-12T22:15:49.970","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"Tuleap is an Open Source Suite to improve management of software developments and collaboration.
