Waiting for the\nadminq_refcnt to hit 1 allows for any current users of the adminq\nto finish before the driver frees the adminq.

checked with host\nlock every time for deciding if error handler kthread needs to be waken up.\n\nThis can be too heavy in case of recovery, such as:\n\n - N hardware queues\n\n - queue depth is M for each hardware queue\n\n - each scsi_host_busy() iterates over (N * M) tag\/requests\n\nIf recovery is triggered in case that all requests are in-flight, each\nscsi_eh_wakeup() is strictly serialized, when scsi_eh_wakeup() is called\nfor the last in-flight request, scsi_host_busy() has been run for (N * M -\n1) times, and request has been iterated for (N*M - 1) * (N * M) times.\n\nIf both N and M are big enough, hard lockup can be triggered on acquiring\nhost lock, and it is observed on mpi3mr(128 hw queues, queue depth 8169).\n\nFix the issue by calling scsi_host_busy() outside the host lock.

That way it's\nimpossible for a BO to get freed while eviction work is pending and the\ncancel_work_sync call in svm_range_bo_release can be eliminated.\n\nv2: Use svm_bo_ref_unless_zero and explained why that's safe.
