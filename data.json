In case the\nfirst extent record in catalog file gets full, new ones are allocated from\nextents overflow file.\n\nIn case shrinking truncate happens to middle of an extent record which\nlocates in extents overflow file, the logic in hfsplus_file_truncate() was\nchanged so that call to hfs_brec_remove() is not guarded any more.\n\nRight action would be just freeing the extents that exceed the new size\ninside extent record by calling hfsplus_free_extents(), and then check if\nthe whole extent record should be removed.  However since the guard\n(blk_cnt > start) is now after the call to hfs_brec_remove(), this has\nunfortunate effect that the last matching extent record is removed\nunconditionally.\n\nTo reproduce this issue, create a file which has at least 10 extents, and\nthen perform shrinking truncate into middle of the last extent record, so\nthat the number of remaining extents is not under or divisible by 8.  This\ncauses the last extent record (8 extents) to be removed totally instead of\ntruncating into middle of it.  Thus this causes corruption, and lost data.\n\nFix for this is simply checking if the new truncated end is below the\nstart of this extent record, making it safe to remove the full extent\nrecord.  However call to hfs_brec_remove() can't be moved to it's previous\nplace since we're dropping ->tree_lock and it can cause a race condition\nand the cached info being invalidated possibly corrupting the node data.\n\nAnother issue is related to this one.  When entering into the block\n(blk_cnt > start) we are not holding the ->tree_lock.  We break out from\nthe loop not holding the lock, but hfs_find_exit() does unlock it.  Not\nsure if it's possible for someone else to take the lock under our feet,\nbut it can cause hard to debug errors and premature unlocking.

ptesync is needed to order the update of the PTE\nwith subsequent accesses otherwise a spurious fault may be raised.\n\nradix__set_pte_at() does not do this for performance gains. For\nnon-kernel memory this is not an issue as any faults of this kind are\ncorrected by the page fault handler. For kernel memory these faults\nare not handled. The current solution is that there is a ptesync in\nflush_cache_vmap() which should be called when mapping from the\nvmalloc region.\n\nHowever, map_kernel_page() does not call flush_cache_vmap(). This is\ntroublesome in particular for code patching with Strict RWX on radix.\nIn do_patch_instruction() the page frame that contains the instruction\nto be patched is mapped and then immediately patched. With no ordering\nor synchronization between setting up the PTE and writing to the page\nit is possible for faults.\n\nAs the code patching is done using __put_user_asm_goto() the resulting\nfault is obscured - but using a normal store instead it can be seen:\n\n  BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access on write at 0xc008000008f24a3c\n  Faulting instruction address: 0xc00000000008bd74\n  Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]\n  LE PAGE_SIZE=64K MMU=Radix SMP NR_CPUS=2048 NUMA PowerNV\n  Modules linked in: nop_module(PO+) [last unloaded: nop_module]\n  CPU: 4 PID: 757 Comm: sh Tainted: P           O      5.10.0-rc5-01361-ge3c1b78c8440-dirty #43\n  NIP:  c00000000008bd74 LR: c00000000008bd50 CTR: c000000000025810\n  REGS: c000000016f634a0 TRAP: 0300   Tainted: P           O       (5.10.0-rc5-01361-ge3c1b78c8440-dirty)\n  MSR:  9000000000009033 <SF,HV,EE,ME,IR,DR,RI,LE>  CR: 44002884  XER: 00000000\n  CFAR: c00000000007c68c DAR: c008000008f24a3c DSISR: 42000000 IRQMASK: 1\n\nThis results in the kind of issue reported here:\n  https:\/\/lore.kernel.org\/linuxppc-dev\/15AC5B0E-A221-4B8C-9039-FA96B8EF7C88@lca.pw\/\n\nChris Riedl suggested a reliable way to reproduce the issue:\n  $ mount -t debugfs none \/sys\/kernel\/debug\n  $ (while true; do echo function > \/sys\/kernel\/debug\/tracing\/current_tracer ; echo nop > \/sys\/kernel\/debug\/tracing\/current_tracer ; done) &\n\nTurning ftrace on and off does a large amount of code patching which\nin usually less then 5min will crash giving a trace like:\n\n   ftrace-powerpc: (____ptrval____): replaced (4b473b11) != old (60000000)\n   ------------[ ftrace bug ]------------\n   ftrace failed to modify\n   [<c000000000bf8e5c>] napi_busy_loop+0xc\/0x390\n    actual:   11:3b:47:4b\n   Setting ftrace call site to call ftrace function\n   ftrace record flags: 80000001\n    (1)\n    expected tramp: c00000000006c96c\n   ------------[ cut here ]------------\n   WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 809 at kernel\/trace\/ftrace.c:2065 ftrace_bug+0x28c\/0x2e8\n   Modules linked in: nop_module(PO-) [last unloaded: nop_module]\n   CPU: 4 PID: 809 Comm: sh Tainted: P           O      5.10.0-rc5-01360-gf878ccaf250a #1\n   NIP:  c00000000024f334 LR: c00000000024f330 CTR: c0000000001a5af0\n   REGS: c000000004c8b760 TRAP: 0700   Tainted: P           O       (5.10.0-rc5-01360-gf878ccaf250a)\n   MSR:  900000000282b033 <SF,HV,VEC,VSX,EE,FP,ME,IR,DR,RI,LE>  CR: 28008848  XER: 20040000\n   CFAR: c0000000001a9c98 IRQMASK: 0\n   GPR00: c00000000024f330 c000000004c8b9f0 c000000002770600 0000000000000022\n   GPR04: 00000000ffff7fff c000000004c8b6d0 0000000000000027 c0000007fe9bcdd8\n   GPR08: 0000000000000023 ffffffffffffffd8 0000000000000027 c000000002613118\n   GPR12: 0000000000008000 c0000007fffdca00 0000000000000000 0000000000000000\n   GPR16: 0000000023ec37c5 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 0000000000000008\n   GPR20: c000000004c8bc90 c0000000027a2d20 c000000004c8bcd0 c000000002612fe8\n   GPR24: 0000000000000038 0000000000000030 0000000000000028 0000000000000020\n   GPR28: c000000000ff1b68 c000000000bf8e5c c00000000312f700 c000000000fbb9b0\n   NIP ftrace_bug+0x28c\/0x2e8\n   LR  ftrace_bug+0x288\/0x2e8\n   Call T\n---truncated---"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/01ac203e2119d8922126886ddea309fb676f955f","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/73f9dccb29e4f82574bec2765c0090cdb0404301","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/84c0762633f2a7ac8399e6b97d3b9bb8e6e1d50f","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/b3d5d0983388d6c4fb35f7d722556d5595f167a7","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/b8b2f37cf632434456182e9002d63cbc4cccc50c","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/e40c52ee67b155ad59f59e73ea136d02685f0e0d","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2021-47035","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-02-28T09:15:39.757","lastModified":"2024-02-28T14:06:45.783","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu\/vt-d: Remove WO permissions on second-level paging entries\n\nWhen the first level page table is used for IOVA translation, it only\nsupports Read-Only and Read-Write permissions.

Hitting the race leads to the following\nsequence:\n\n\thidpp->battery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp->battery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);\n\n\t...\n\n\thidpp->battery.desc.properties =\n\t\tdevm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);\n\n\thidpp->battery.ps =\n\t\tdevm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,\n\t\t\t\t\t   &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);\n\nSo now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,\nwhich looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even\nthe really big problem.\n\nNotice how:\n\n1. This is all devm-maganaged\n2. The hidpp->battery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies\n3. hidpp->battery.desc.properties points to the result from the second\n   devm_kmemdup()\n\nThis causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:\n1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered\n2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,\n   hidpp->battery.desc.properties now points to freed memory\n3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,\n   this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes\n   power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data\n4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp->battery.desc.properties which\n   now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:\n\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffb2140e017f08\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: Workqueue: usb_hub_wq hub_event\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: RIP: 0010:power_supply_uevent+0xee\/0x1d0\n...\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x26\/0x30\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0xee\/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  ? power_supply_uevent+0x10d\/0x1d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  dev_uevent+0x10f\/0x2d0\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  kobject_uevent_env+0x291\/0x680\nSep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel:  \n---truncated---"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/093af62c023537f097d2ebdfaa0bc7c1a6e874e1","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/28ddc1e0b898291323b62d770b1b931de131a528","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/44481b244fcaa2b895a53081d6204c574720c38c","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/ca0c4cc1d215dc22ab0e738c9f017c650f3183f5","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/cd0e2bf7fb22fe9b989c59c42dca06367fd10e6b","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/dac501397b9d81e4782232c39f94f4307b137452","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/f7b2c7d9831af99369fe8ad9b2a68d78942f414e","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/fd72ac9556a473fc7daf54efb6ca8a97180d621d","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2023-52479","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-02-29T06:15:45.973","lastModified":"2024-02-29T06:15:45.973","vulnStatus":"Received","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix uaf in smb20_oplock_break_ack\n\ndrop reference after use opinfo."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/694e13732e830cbbfedb562e57f28644927c33fd","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/8226ffc759ea59f10067b9acdf7f94bae1c69930","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/c69813471a1ec081a0b9bf0c6bd7e8afd818afce","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/d5b0e9d3563e7e314a850e81f42b2ef6f39882f9","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2023-52480","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-02-29T06:15:46.017","lastModified":"2024-02-29T06:15:46.017","vulnStatus":"Received","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nksmbd: fix race condition between session lookup and expire\n\n Thread A                        +  Thread B\n ksmbd_session_lookup            |  smb2_sess_setup\n   sess = xa_load                |\n                                 |\n                                 |    xa_erase(&conn->sessions, sess->id);\n                                 |\n                                 |    ksmbd_session_destroy(sess) --> kfree(sess)\n                                 |\n   \/\/ UAF!                       |\n   sess->last_active = jiffies   |\n                                 +\n\nThis patch add rwsem to fix race condition between ksmbd_session_lookup\nand ksmbd_expire_session."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/18ced78b0ebccc2d16f426143dc56ab3aad666be","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/53ff5cf89142b978b1a5ca8dc4d4425e6a09745f","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/a2ca5fd3dbcc665e1169044fa0c9e3eba779202b","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/c77fd3e25a51ac92b0f1b347a96eff6a0b4f066f","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2023-52481","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-02-29T06:15:46.060","lastModified":"2024-02-29T06:15:46.060","vulnStatus":"Received","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: errata: Add Cortex-A520 speculative unprivileged load workaround\n\nImplement the workaround for ARM Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298.
