The vulnerability exists because entity names containing HTML are not properly sanitized before being rendered in graph tooltips.

Additionally, if an energy provider (such as Tibber) supplies a malicious default name for an entity, the vulnerability can be exploited without direct user action when the default name is used.

In versions up to and including commit 781d91157cfc234a434d0bab45cbcf97894c642e, the \/workspace endpoint contains an improper authentication vulnerability that allows an attacker to access any active Windows VM without proper authorization. The vulnerability occurs in the view_desktop function where the user is retrieved via a URL parameter without verifying that the requester has administrative privileges. An attacker can supply any user ID and arbitrary password in the request parameters to impersonate another user. When requesting a Windows desktop service, the function does not validate the supplied password before generating access credentials, allowing the attacker to obtain an iframe source URL that grants full access to the target user's Windows VM. This impacts all users with active Windows VMs, as an attacker can access and modify data on the Windows machine and in the home directory of the associated Linux machine via the Z: drive.

The file has the object as it's private_data and holds\na users refcount, while the object is expected to remain alive as long as\nthe file is.\n\nWhen the allocation of a new object aborts before installing the file it\nwill fput() the file and then go on to immediately kfree() the obj. This\ncauses a UAF once the workqueue completes the fput() and tries to\ndecrement the users refcount.\n\nFix this by putting the core code in charge of the file lifetime, and call\n__fput_sync() during abort to ensure that release() is called before\nkfree. __fput_sync() is a bit too tricky to open code in all the object\nimplementations. Instead the objects tell the core code where the file\npointer is and the core will take care of the life cycle.\n\nIf the object is successfully allocated then the file will hold a users\nrefcount and the iommufd_object cannot be destroyed.\n\nIt is worth noting that close(); ioctl(IOMMU_DESTROY); doesn't have an\nissue because close() is already using a synchronous version of fput().\n\nThe UAF looks like this:\n\n    BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in iommufd_eventq_fops_release+0x45\/0xc0 drivers\/iommu\/iommufd\/eventq.c:376\n    Write of size 4 at addr ffff888059c97804 by task syz.0.46\/6164\n\n    CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 6164 Comm: syz.0.46 Not tainted syzkaller #0 PREEMPT(full)\n    Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine\/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 08\/18\/2025\n    Call Trace:\n     <TASK>\n     __dump_stack lib\/dump_stack.c:94 [inline]\n     dump_stack_lvl+0x116\/0x1f0 lib\/dump_stack.c:120\n     print_address_description mm\/kasan\/report.c:378 [inline]\n     print_report+0xcd\/0x630 mm\/kasan\/report.c:482\n     kasan_report+0xe0\/0x110 mm\/kasan\/report.c:595\n     check_region_inline mm\/kasan\/generic.c:183 [inline]\n     kasan_check_range+0x100\/0x1b0 mm\/kasan\/generic.c:189\n     instrument_atomic_read_write include\/linux\/instrumented.h:96 [inline]\n     atomic_fetch_sub_release include\/linux\/atomic\/atomic-instrumented.h:400 [inline]\n     __refcount_dec include\/linux\/refcount.h:455 [inline]\n     refcount_dec include\/linux\/refcount.h:476 [inline]\n     iommufd_eventq_fops_release+0x45\/0xc0 drivers\/iommu\/iommufd\/eventq.c:376\n     __fput+0x402\/0xb70 fs\/file_table.c:468\n     task_work_run+0x14d\/0x240 kernel\/task_work.c:227\n     resume_user_mode_work include\/linux\/resume_user_mode.h:50 [inline]\n     exit_to_user_mode_loop+0xeb\/0x110 kernel\/entry\/common.c:43\n     exit_to_user_mode_prepare include\/linux\/irq-entry-common.h:225 [inline]\n     syscall_exit_to_user_mode_work include\/linux\/entry-common.h:175 [inline]\n     syscall_exit_to_user_mode include\/linux\/entry-common.h:210 [inline]\n     do_syscall_64+0x41c\/0x4c0 arch\/x86\/entry\/syscall_64.c:100\n     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77\/0x7f"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/17195a7d754a5c6a31888702ca93f6f08f3383ad","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/4e034bf045b12852a24d5d33f2451850818ba0c1","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/e4825368285e33d6360c6c6a6a10d2d83da06e55","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-39967","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-10-15T08:15:34.210","lastModified":"2025-10-15T08:15:34.210","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbcon: fix integer overflow in fbcon_do_set_font\n\nFix integer overflow vulnerabilities in fbcon_do_set_font() where font\nsize calculations could overflow when handling user-controlled font\nparameters.\n\nThe vulnerabilities occur when:\n1.

between nodes.\n\nWhen spark.network.crypto.enabled is set to true (it is set to false by default), but spark.network.crypto.cipher is not explicitly configured, Spark defaults to AES in CTR mode (AES\/CTR\/NoPadding), which provides encryption without authentication.\n\nThis vulnerability allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to modify encrypted RPC traffic undetected by flipping bits in ciphertext, potentially compromising heartbeat messages or application data and affecting the integrity of Spark workflows.\n\n\nTo mitigate this issue, users should either configure

is an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework. In versions prior to 4.1.128.Final and 4.2.7.Final, the SMTP codec in Netty contains an SMTP command injection vulnerability due to insufficient input validation for Carriage Return (\\r) and Line Feed (\\n) characters in user-supplied parameters. The vulnerability exists in io.netty.handler.codec.smtp.DefaultSmtpRequest, where parameters are directly concatenated into the SMTP command string without sanitization. When methods such as SmtpRequests.rcpt(recipient) are called with a malicious string containing CRLF sequences, attackers can inject arbitrary SMTP commands. Because the injected commands are sent from the server's trusted IP address, resulting emails will likely pass SPF and DKIM authentication checks, making them appear legitimate. This allows remote attackers who can control SMTP command parameters (such as email recipients) to forge arbitrary emails from the trusted server, potentially impersonating executives and forging high-stakes corporate communications.

The vulnerable route is only registered when a Codespaces environment is detected, and the detection is controlled by environment variables.

In versions 1.2.0-rc.1 through 1.2.0-rc.11, a logic flaw exists in the message command handler that affects how the commandName property is exposed to both middleware functions and command execution contexts when handling command aliases. When a message command is invoked using an alias, the ctx.commandName value reflects the alias rather than the canonical command name. This occurs in both middleware functions and within the command's own run function. Although not explicitly documented, CommandKit's examples and guidance around middleware usage implicitly convey that ctx.commandName represents the canonical command identifier. Middleware examples in the documentation consistently use ctx.commandName to reference the command being executed. Developers who assume ctx.commandName is canonical may introduce unintended behavior when relying on it for logic such as permission checks, rate limiting, or audit logging. This could allow unauthorized command execution or inaccurate access control decisions. Slash commands and context menu commands are not affected.
