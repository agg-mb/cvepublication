In some case that delete attempt fails when\nthe target inode is a directory that contains a subvolume inside it, since\nthe log replay code is not prepared to deal with directory entries that\npoint to root items (only inode items).\n\n1) We have directories \"dir1\" (inode A) and \"dir2\" (inode B) under the\n   same parent directory;\n\n2) We have a file (inode C) under directory \"dir1\" (inode A);\n\n3) We have a subvolume inside directory \"dir2\" (inode B);\n\n4) All these inodes were persisted in a past transaction and we are\n   currently at transaction N;\n\n5) We rename the file (inode C), so at btrfs_log_new_name() we update\n   inode C's last_unlink_trans to N;\n\n6) We get a rename exchange for \"dir1\" (inode A) and \"dir2\" (inode B),\n   so after the exchange \"dir1\" is inode B and \"dir2\" is inode A.\n   During the rename exchange we call btrfs_log_new_name() for inodes\n   A and B, but because they are directories, we don't update their\n   last_unlink_trans to N;\n\n7) An fsync against the file (inode C) is done, and because its inode\n   has a last_unlink_trans with a value of N we log its parent directory\n   (inode A) (through btrfs_log_all_parents(), called from\n   btrfs_log_inode_parent()).\n\n8) So we end up with inode B not logged, which now has the old name\n   of inode A. At copy_inode_items_to_log(), when logging inode A, we\n   did not check if we had any conflicting inode to log because inode\n   A has a generation lower than the current transaction (created in\n   a past transaction);\n\n9) After a power failure, when replaying the log tree, since we find that\n   inode A has a new name that conflicts with the name of inode B in the\n   fs tree, we attempt to delete inode B... this is wrong since that\n   directory was never deleted before the power failure, and because there\n   is a subvolume inside that directory, attempting to delete it will fail\n   since replay_dir_deletes() and btrfs_unlink_inode() are not prepared\n   to deal with dir items that point to roots instead of inodes.\n\n   When that happens the mount fails and we get a stack trace like the\n   following:\n\n   [87.2314] BTRFS info (device dm-0): start tree-log replay\n   [87.2318] BTRFS critical (device dm-0): failed to delete reference to subvol, root 5 inode 256 parent 259\n   [87.2332] ------------[ cut here ]------------\n   [87.2338] BTRFS: Transaction aborted (error -2)\n   [87.2346] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 638968 at fs\/btrfs\/inode.c:4345 __btrfs_unlink_inode+0x416\/0x440 [btrfs]\n   [87.2368] Modules linked in: btrfs loop dm_thin_pool (...)\n   [87.2470] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 638968 Comm: mount Tainted: G        W           6.18.0-rc7-btrfs-next-218+ #2 PREEMPT(full)\n   [87.2489] Tainted: [W]=WARN\n   [87.2494] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.2-0-gea1b7a073390-prebuilt.qemu.org 04\/01\/2014\n   [87.2514] RIP: 0010:__btrfs_unlink_inode+0x416\/0x440 [btrfs]\n   [87.2538] Code: c0 89 04 24 (...)\n   [87.2568] RSP: 0018:ffffc0e741f4b9b8 EFLAGS: 00010286\n   [87.2574] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffff9d3ec8a6cf60 RCX: 0000000000000000\n   [87.2582] RDX: 0000000000000002 RSI: ffffffff84ab45a1 RDI: 00000000ffffffff\n   [87.2591] RBP: ffff9d3ec8a6ef20 R08: 0000000000000000 R09: ffffc0e741f4b840\n   [87.2599] R10: ffff9d45dc1fffa8 R11: 0000000000000003 R12: ffff9d3ee26d77e0\n   [87.2608] R13: ffffc0e741f4ba98 R14: ffff9d4458040800 R15: ffff9d44b6b7ca10\n   [87.2618] FS:  00007f7b9603a840(0000) GS:ffff9d4658982000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n   [87.\n---truncated---"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/0c2413c69129f6ce60157f7b53d9ba880260400b","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/7ba0b6461bc4edb3005ea6e00cdae189bcf908a5","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/a63998cd6687c14b160dccb0bbcf281b2eb0dab3","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/c7f0207db68d5a1b4af23acbef1a8e8ddc431ebb","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/d52af58dd463821c5c516aebb031a58934f696ea","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-71184","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2026-01-31T12:16:03.673","lastModified":"2026-01-31T12:16:03.673","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix NULL dereference on root when tracing inode eviction\n\nWhen evicting an inode the first thing we do is to setup tracing for it,\nwhich implies fetching the root's id.

The code is\ndesigned to work this way without disabling IRQs and occasionally fail the\ntrylock with a fallback.  However, the SMP=n spinlock implementation\nassumes spin_trylock() will always succeed, and thus it's normally a\nno-op.  Here the enabled lock debugging catches the problem, but otherwise\nit could cause a corruption of the pcp structure.\n\nThe problem has been introduced by commit 574907741599 (\"mm\/page_alloc:\nleave IRQs enabled for per-cpu page allocations\").  The pcp locking scheme\nrecognizes the need for disabling IRQs to prevent nesting spin_trylock()\nsections on SMP=n, but the need to prevent the nesting in spin_lock() has\nnot been recognized.  Fix it by introducing local wrappers that change the\nspin_lock() to spin_lock_iqsave() with SMP=n and use them in all places\nthat do spin_lock(&pcp->lock).\n\n[vbabka@suse.cz: add pcp_ prefix to the spin_lock_irqsave wrappers, per Steven]"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/038a102535eb49e10e93eafac54352fcc5d78847","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/3098f8f7c7b0686c74827aec42a2c45e69801ff8","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/4a04ff9cd816e7346fcc8126f00ed80481f6569d","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/df63d31e9ae02e2f6cd96147779e4ed7cd0e75f6","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2026-23026","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2026-01-31T12:16:05.920","lastModified":"2026-01-31T12:16:05.920","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndmaengine: qcom: gpi: Fix memory leak in gpi_peripheral_config()\n\nFix a memory leak in gpi_peripheral_config() where the original memory\npointed to by gchan->config could be lost if krealloc() fails.\n\nThe issue occurs when:\n1. gchan->config points to previously allocated memory\n2. krealloc() fails and returns NULL\n3.
