In macvlan case, macvlan driver retains clone(s) of the mcast skb\n    and schedules a work queue to send them out on the lower devices.\n\n    The clone skb->_nfct is not a copy, it is the same entry as the\n    original skb.  The macvlan rx handler then returns RX_HANDLER_PASS.\n 5. Normal conntrack hooks (in NF_INET_LOCAL_IN) confirm the orig skb.\n\nThe Macvlan broadcast worker and normal confirm path will race.\n\nThis race will not happen if step 2 already confirmed a clone.

1.2.3.5\n\nFor multicast case, only one of such conflicting mappings will be\ncreated, conntrack only handles 1:1 NAT mappings.\n\nUsers should set create a setup that explicitly marks such

Calling get_shadow_from_swap_cache() on it\n   will result in an out-of-bounds access to swapper_spaces[].\n\n   Validate the entry with non_swap_entry() before going further.\n\n2) When we find a valid swap entry in the shmem's inode, the shadow\n   entry in the swapcache might not exist yet: swap IO is still in\n   progress and we're before __remove_mapping; swapin, invalidation,\n   or swapoff have removed the shadow from swapcache after we saw the\n   shmem swap entry.\n\n   This will send a NULL to workingset_test_recent().

It only guarantees that the suspend and resume callbacks\nwill not be running when it returns.\n\nHowever, if a .runtime_idle() callback is already running when\npm_runtime_get_sync() is called, the latter will notice that the runtime PM\nstatus of the device is RPM_ACTIVE and it will return right away without\nwaiting for the former to complete.  In fact, it cannot wait for\n.runtime_idle() to complete because it may be called from that callback (it\narguably does not make much sense to do that, but it is not strictly\nprohibited).\n\nThus in general, whoever is providing a .runtime_idle() callback needs\nto protect it from running in parallel with whatever code runs after\npm_runtime_get_sync().  [Note that .runtime_idle() will not start after\npm_runtime_get_sync() has returned, but it may continue running then if it\nhas started earlier.]\n\nOne way to address that race condition is to call pm_runtime_barrier()\nafter pm_runtime_get_sync() (not before it, because a nonzero value of the\nruntime PM usage counter is necessary to prevent runtime PM callbacks from\nbeing invoked) to wait for the .runtime_idle() callback to complete should\nit be running at that point.  A suitable place for doing that is in\npci_device_remove() which calls pm_runtime_get_sync() before removing the\ndriver, so it may as well call pm_runtime_barrier() subsequently, which\nwill prevent the race in question from occurring, not just in the rtsx_pcr\ndriver, but in any PCI drivers providing .runtime_idle() callbacks."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/47d8aafcfe313511a98f165a54d0adceb34e54b1","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/6347348c6aba52dda0b33296684cbb627bdc6970","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/7cc94dd36e48879e76ae7a8daea4ff322b7d9674","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/900b81caf00c89417172afe0e7e49ac4eb110f4b","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/9a87375bb586515c0af63d5dcdcd58ec4acf20a6","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/9d5286d4e7f68beab450deddbb6a32edd5ecf4bf","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/bbe068b24409ef740657215605284fc7cdddd491","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/d534198311c345e4b062c4b88bb609efb8bd91d5","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/d86ad8c3e152349454b82f37007ff6ba45f26989","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-35810","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-05-17T14:15:14.970","lastModified":"2024-05-17T18:35:35.070","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm\/vmwgfx: Fix the lifetime of the bo cursor memory\n\nThe cleanup can be dispatched while the atomic update is still active,\nwhich means that the memory acquired in the atomic update needs to\nnot be invalidated by the cleanup.

Between the register being\ninconsistently checked to be below 1<<29, and the offset being up to an\nu32, it appears that we were open to overflowing the `int`s which were\ncurrently used for arithmetic.\n\n[1] https:\/\/github.com\/torvalds\/linux\/blob\/815fb87b753055df2d9e50f6cd80eb10235fe3e9\/kernel\/bpf\/verifier.c#L7494-L7498\n[2] https:\/\/github.com\/torvalds\/linux\/blob\/815fb87b753055df2d9e50f6cd80eb10235fe3e9\/kernel\/bpf\/verifier.c#L11904"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/1d38a9ee81570c4bd61f557832dead4d6f816760","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/ad140fc856f0b1d5e2215bcb6d0cc247a86805a2","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/e5ad9ecb84405637df82732ee02ad741a5f782a6","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2023-52677","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-05-17T15:15:18.823","lastModified":"2024-05-17T18:35:35.070","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nriscv: Check if the code to patch lies in the exit section\n\nOtherwise we fall through to vmalloc_to_page() which panics since the\naddress does not lie in the vmalloc region."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/1d7a03052846f34d624d0ab41a879adf5e85c85f","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/420370f3ae3d3b883813fd3051a38805160b2b9f","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/890cfe5337e0aaf03ece1429db04d23c88da72e7","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/8db56df4a954b774bdc68917046a685a9fa2e4bc","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/938f70d14618ec72e10d6fcf8a546134136d7c13","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2023-52678","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-05-17T15:15:19.057","lastModified":"2024-05-17T18:35:35.070","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm\/amdkfd: Confirm list is non-empty before utilizing list_first_entry in kfd_topology.c\n\nBefore using list_first_entry, make sure to check that list is not\nempty, if list is empty return -ENODATA.\n\nFixes the below:\ndrivers\/gpu\/drm\/amd\/amdgpu\/..\/amdkfd\/kfd_topology.c:1347 kfd_create_indirect_link_prop() warn: can 'gpu_link' even be NULL?\ndrivers\/gpu\/drm\/amd\/amdgpu\/..\/amdkfd\/kfd_topology.c:1428 kfd_add_peer_prop() warn: can 'iolink1' even be NULL?\ndrivers\/gpu\/drm\/amd\/amdgpu\/..\/amdkfd\/kfd_topology.c:1433 kfd_add_peer_prop() warn: can 'iolink2' even be NULL?"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/4525525cb7161d08f95d0e47025323dd10214313","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/499839eca34ad62d43025ec0b46b80e77065f6d8","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/4ac4e023ed7ab1c7c67d2d12b7b6198fcd099e5c","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/5024cce888e11e5688f77df81db9e14828495d64","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2023-52679","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-05-17T15:15:19.207","lastModified":"2024-05-17T18:35:35.070","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nof: Fix double free in of_parse_phandle_with_args_map\n\nIn of_parse_phandle_with_args_map() the inner loop that\niterates through the map entries calls of_node_put(new)\nto free the reference acquired by the previous iteration\nof the inner loop.
