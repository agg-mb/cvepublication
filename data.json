The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can lead to the injection of an arbitrary script. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account.

This vulnerability affects all Linux and PortableApps.com users of all PWAsForFirefox versions up to (excluding) 2.12.0. Windows and macOS users are not affected. This vulnerability has been fixed in commit `9932d4b` which has been included in release in v2.12.0. The main fix is implemented in the native part, but the extension also contains additional fixes.

could give\nfalse positives.\n\nThere has been attempts to make page_is_pfmemalloc() more robust,\nbut not using it in the first place in this context is probably better,\nremoving cpu cycles.\n\nNote to stable teams :\n\nYou need to backport 84ce071e38a6 (\"net: introduce\n__skb_fill_page_desc_noacc\") as a prereq.\n\nRace is more probable after commit c07aea3ef4d4\n(\"mm: add a signature in struct page\") because page_is_pfmemalloc()\nis now using low order bit from page->lru.next, which can change\nmore often than page->index.\n\nLow order bit should never be set for lru.next (when used as an anchor\nin LRU list), so KCSAN report is mostly a false positive.\n\nBackporting to older kernel versions seems not necessary.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KCSAN: data-race in lru_add_fn \/
