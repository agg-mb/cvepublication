The program returns struct xdp_md's\negress_ifindex, and the latter is only allowed to be accessed under mentioned\nexpected_attach_type. progB is then inserted into the tailcall which progA\ncalls.\n\nThe underlying issue goes beyond XDP though. Another example are programs\nof type BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR. sock_addr_is_valid_access() as well\nas sock_addr_func_proto() have different logic depending on the programs'\nexpected_attach_type.

Fix it by enforcing\nexpected_attach_type in __bpf_prog_map_compatible().\n\nNote that we only enforce this for tailcall maps, but not for BPF devmaps or\ncpumaps: There, the programs are invoked through dev_map_bpf_prog_run*() and\ncpu_map_bpf_prog_run*() which set up a new environment \/ context and therefore\nthese situations are not prone to this issue."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/08cb3dc9d2b44f153d0bcf2cb966e4a94b5d0f32","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/4540aed51b12bc13364149bf95f6ecef013197c0","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/a99de19128aec0913f3d529f529fbbff5edfaff8","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/c1ad19b5d8e23123503dcaf2d4342e1b90b923ad","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/f856c598080ba7ce1252867b8ecd6ad5bdaf9a6a","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-40124","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-11-12T11:15:41.920","lastModified":"2025-11-12T11:15:41.920","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsparc: fix accurate exception reporting in copy_{from_to}_user for UltraSPARC III\n\nAnthony Yznaga tracked down that a BUG_ON in ext4 code with large folios\nenabled resulted from copy_from_user() returning impossibly large values\ngreater than the size to be copied.
