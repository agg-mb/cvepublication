Prior to versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, and 4.0.4, attempting to parse a patch whose filename headers contain the line break characters `\\r`, `\\u2028`, or `\\u2029` can cause the `parsePatch` method to enter an infinite loop. It then consumes memory without limit until the process crashes due to running out of memory. Applications are therefore likely to be vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack if they call `parsePatch` with a user-provided patch as input. A large payload is not needed to trigger the vulnerability, so size limits on user input do not provide any protection. Furthermore, some applications may be vulnerable even when calling `parsePatch` on a patch generated by the application itself if the user is nonetheless able to control the filename headers (e.g. by directly providing the filenames of the files to be diffed). The `applyPatch` method is similarly affected if (and only if) called with a string representation of a patch as an argument, since under the hood it parses that string using `parsePatch`. Other methods of the library are unaffected. Finally, a second and lesser interdependent bug - a ReDOS - also exhibits when those same line break characters are present in a patch's *patch* header (also known as its \"leading garbage\"). A maliciously-crafted patch header of length *n* can take `parsePatch` O(*n*³) time to parse. Versions 8.0.3, 5.2.2, and 4.0.4 contain a fix.

The driver allocates a 128-byte non-paged pool buffer and, upon receiving IOCTL 0x222060, maps it into user space using an MDL and MmMapLockedPagesSpecifyCache. Because the allocation size is not page-aligned, the mapping exposes the entire 0x1000-byte kernel page containing the buffer plus adjacent non-paged pool allocations with read\/write permissions. An unprivileged local attacker can open a device handle (using the required 0x800 attribute flag), invoke the IOCTL to obtain the mapping, and then read or modify live kernel objects and pointers present on that page. This enables bypass of KASLR, arbitrary kernel memory read\/write within the exposed page, corruption of kernel objects, and escalation to SYSTEM."}],"metrics":{"cvssMetricV40":[{"source":"disclosure@vulncheck.com","type":"Secondary","cvssData":{"version":"4.0","vectorString":"CVSS:4.0\/AV:L\/AC:L\/AT:N\/PR:L\/UI:N\/VC:H\/VI:H\/VA:H\/SC:N\/SI:N\/SA:N\/E:X\/CR:X\/IR:X\/AR:X\/MAV:X\/MAC:X\/MAT:X\/MPR:X\/MUI:X\/MVC:X\/MVI:X\/MVA:X\/MSC:X\/MSI:X\/MSA:X\/S:X\/AU:X\/R:X\/V:X\/RE:X\/U:X","baseScore":8.5,"baseSeverity":"HIGH","attackVector":"LOCAL","attackComplexity":"LOW","attackRequirements":"NONE","privilegesRequired":"LOW","userInteraction":"NONE","vulnConfidentialityImpact":"HIGH","vulnIntegrityImpact":"HIGH","vulnAvailabilityImpact":"HIGH","subConfidentialityImpact":"NONE","subIntegrityImpact":"NONE","subAvailabilityImpact":"NONE","exploitMaturity":"NOT_DEFINED","confidentialityRequirement":"NOT_DEFINED","integrityRequirement":"NOT_DEFINED","availabilityRequirement":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedAttackVector":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedAttackComplexity":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedAttackRequirements":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedPrivilegesRequired":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedUserInteraction":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedVulnConfidentialityImpact":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedVulnIntegrityImpact":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedVulnAvailabilityImpact":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedSubConfidentialityImpact":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedSubIntegrityImpact":"NOT_DEFINED","modifiedSubAvailabilityImpact":"NOT_DEFINED","Safety":"NOT_DEFINED","Automatable":"NOT_DEFINED","Recovery":"NOT_DEFINED","valueDensity":"NOT_DEFINED","vulnerabilityResponseEffort":"NOT_DEFINED","providerUrgency":"NOT_DEFINED"}}]},"weaknesses":[{"source":"disclosure@vulncheck.com","type":"Primary","description":[{"lang":"en","value":"CWE-668"}]}],"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/forum.vb-audio.com\/viewtopic.php?p=7527#p7527","source":"disclosure@vulncheck.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/forum.vb-audio.com\/viewtopic.php?p=7574#p7574","source":"disclosure@vulncheck.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/emkaix\/security-research\/tree\/main\/CVE-2026-23763","source":"disclosure@vulncheck.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/vb-audio.com\/","source":"disclosure@vulncheck.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/www.vulncheck.com\/advisories\/vb-audio-matrix-drivers-local-privilege-escalation-via-kernel-memory-exposure","source":"disclosure@vulncheck.com"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2026-23764","sourceIdentifier":"disclosure@vulncheck.com","published":"2026-01-22T17:16:37.757","lastModified":"2026-01-22T17:16:37.757","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"VB-Audio Voicemeeter, Voicemeeter Banana, and Voicemeeter Potato (versions ending in 1.1.1.9, 2.1.1.9, and 3.1.1.9 and earlier, respectively), as well as VB-Audio Matrix and Matrix Coconut (versions ending in 1.0.2.2 and 2.0.2.2 and earlier, respectively), contain a vulnerability in their virtual audio drivers (vbvoicemeetervaio64*.sys, vbmatrixvaio64*.sys, vbaudio_vmauxvaio*.sys, vbaudio_vmvaio*.sys, and vbaudio_vmvaio3*.sys).
