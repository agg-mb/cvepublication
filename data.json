This can result in a later warning from\nfpsimd_restore_current_state(), e.g.\n\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 7214 at arch\/arm64\/kernel\/fpsimd.c:383 fpsimd_restore_current_state+0x50c\/0x748\n\nWhen this happens, fpsimd_restore_current_state() will set TIF_SVE,\nplacing the task into the correct state. This occurs before any other\ncheck of TIF_SVE can possibly occur, as other checks of TIF_SVE only\nhappen while the FPSIMD\/SVE\/SME state is live. Thus, aside from the\nwarning, there is no functional issue.\n\nThis bug was introduced during rework to error handling in commit:\n\n  9f8bf718f2923 (\"arm64\/fpsimd: ptrace: Gracefully handle errors\")\n\n... where the setting of TIF_SVE was moved into a block which is only\nexecuted when system_supports_sme() is true.\n\nFix this by removing the system_supports_sme() check. This ensures that\nTIF_SVE is set for (SVE-formatted) writes to NT_ARM_SVE, at the cost of\nunconditionally manipulating the tracee's saved svcr value. The\nmanipulation of svcr is benign and inexpensive, and we already do\nsimilar elsewhere (e.g. during signal handling), so I don't think it's\nworth guarding this with system_supports_sme() checks.\n\nAside from the above, there is no functional change. The 'type' argument\nto sve_set_common() is only set to ARM64_VEC_SME (in ssve_set())) when\nsystem_supports_sme(), so the ARM64_VEC_SME case in the switch statement\nis still unreachable when !system_supports_sme().

In this case, the\ncommand sequence is currently:\n\n- SCTP_CMD_PEER_INIT\n- SCTP_CMD_TIMER_STOP (T1_INIT)\n- SCTP_CMD_TIMER_START (T1_COOKIE)\n- SCTP_CMD_NEW_STATE (COOKIE_ECHOED)\n- SCTP_CMD_ASSOC_SHKEY\n- SCTP_CMD_GEN_COOKIE_ECHO\n\nIf SCTP_CMD_ASSOC_SHKEY fails, asoc->shkey remains NULL, while\nasoc->peer.auth_capable and asoc->peer.peer_chunks have already been set by\nSCTP_CMD_PEER_INIT. This allows a DATA chunk with auth = 1 and shkey = NULL\nto be queued by sctp_datamsg_from_user().\n\nSince command interpretation stops on failure, no COOKIE_ECHO should been\nsent via SCTP_CMD_GEN_COOKIE_ECHO. However, the T1_COOKIE timer has already\nbeen started, and it may enqueue a COOKIE_ECHO into the outqueue later. As\na result, the DATA chunk can be transmitted together with the COOKIE_ECHO\nin sctp_outq_flush_data(), leading to the observed issue.\n\nSimilar to the other places where it calls sctp_auth_asoc_init_active_key()\nright after sctp_process_init(), this patch moves the SCTP_CMD_ASSOC_SHKEY\nimmediately after SCTP_CMD_PEER_INIT, before stopping T1_INIT and starting\nT1_COOKIE. This ensures that if shared key generation fails, authenticated\nDATA cannot be sent.

The 'ZERO' subreq that clears the tail\nhappens after we unlock the folio, allowing the application to see the\nuncleared tail through mmap.\n\nThe problem is that netfs_read_unlock_folios() will unlock a folio in which\nthe amount of read results collected hits EOF position - but the ZERO\nsubreq lies beyond that and so happens after.\n\nFix this by changing the end check to always be the end of the folio and\nnever the end of the file.\n\nIn the future, I should look at clearing to the end of the folio here rather\nthan adding a ZERO subreq to do this.  On the other hand, the ZERO subreq can\nrun in parallel with an async READ subreq.  Further, the ZERO subreq may still\nbe necessary to, say, handle extents in a ceph file that don't have any\nbacking store and are thus implicitly all zeros.\n\nThis can be reproduced by creating a file, the size of which doesn't align\nto a page boundary, e.g. 24998 (0x5fb2) bytes and then doing something\nlike:\n\n    xfs_io -c \"mmap -r 0 0x6000\" -c \"madvise -d 0 0x6000\" \\\n           -c \"mread -v 0 0x6000\" \/xfstest.test\/x\n\nThe last 0x4e bytes should all be 00, but if the tail hasn't been cleared\nyet, you may see rubbish there.  This can be reproduced with kafs by\nmodifying the kernel to disable the call to netfs_read_subreq_progress()\nand to stop afs_issue_read() from doing the async call for NETFS_READAHEAD.\nReproduction can be made easier by inserting an mdelay(100) in\nnetfs_issue_read() for the ZERO-subreq case.\n\nAFS and CIFS are normally unlikely to show this as they dispatch READ ops\nasynchronously, which allows the ZERO-subreq to finish first.  9P's READ op is\ncompletely synchronous, so the ZERO-subreq will always happen after.  It isn't\nseen all the time, though, because the collection may be done in a worker\nthread."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/570ad253a3455a520f03c2136af8714bc780186d","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/5b5482c0e5ee740b35a70759d3582477aea8e8e4","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-71202","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2026-02-14T16:15:52.790","lastModified":"2026-02-14T16:15:52.790","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu\/sva: invalidate stale IOTLB entries for kernel address space\n\nIntroduce a new IOMMU interface to flush IOTLB paging cache entries for\nthe CPU kernel address space.

Thus when\n  a task is dirtying pages it periodically enters into balance_dirty_pages()\n  and we let it sleep there to slow down the dirtying.\n\n  When the system is over dirty limit already (either globally or within\n  a cgroup of the running task), we will not let the task exit from\n  balance_dirty_pages() until the number of dirty pages drops below the\n  limit.\n\n  So in this particular case, as I already mentioned, there was a cgroup\n  with relatively small amount of memory and as a result with dirty limit\n  set at 16MB. A task from that cgroup has dirtied about 28MB worth of\n  pages in btrfs btree inode and these were practically the only dirty\n  pages in that cgroup.\n\nSo that means the only way to reduce the dirty pages of that cgroup is\nto writeback the dirty pages of btrfs btree inode, and only after that\nthose processes can exit balance_dirty_pages().\n\nNow back to the btrfs part, btree_writepages() is responsible for\nwriting back dirty btree inode pages.\n\nThe problem here is, there is a btrfs internal threshold that if the\nbtree inode's dirty bytes are below the 32M threshold, it will not\ndo any writeback.\n\nThis behavior is to batch as much metadata as possible so we won't write\nback those tree blocks and then later re-COW them again for another\nmodification.\n\nThis internal 32MiB is higher than the existing dirty page size (28MiB),\nmeaning no writeback will happen, causing a deadlock between btrfs and\ncgroup:\n\n- Btrfs doesn't want to write back btree inode until more dirty pages\n\n- Cgroup\/MM doesn't want more dirty pages for btrfs btree inode\n  Thus any process touching that btree inode is put into sleep until\n  the number of dirty pages is reduced.\n\nThanks Jan Kara a lot for the analysis of the root cause.\n\n[ENHANCEMENT]\nSince kernel commit b55102826d7d (\"btrfs: set AS_KERNEL_FILE on the\nbtree_inode\"), btrfs btree inode pages will only be charged to the root\ncgroup which should have a much larger limit than btrfs' 32MiB\nthreshold.\nSo it should not affect newer kernels.\n\nBut for all current LTS kernels, they are all affected by this problem,\nand backporting the whole AS_KERNEL_FILE may not be a good idea.\n\nEven for newer kernels I still think it's a good idea to get\nrid of the internal threshold at btree_writepages(), since for most cases\ncgroup\/MM has a better view of full system memory usage than btrfs' fixed\nthreshold.\n\nFor internal callers using btrfs_btree_balance_dirty() since that\nfunction is already doing internal threshold check, we don't need to\nbother them.\n\nBut for external callers of btree_writepages(), just respect their\nrequests and write back whatever they want, ignoring the internal\nbtrfs threshold to avoid such deadlock on btree inode dirty page\nbalancing."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/4e159150a9a56d66d247f4b5510bed46fe58aa1c","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/629666d20c7dcd740e193ec0631fdff035b1f7d6","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2026-23158","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2026-02-14T16:15:55.967","lastModified":"2026-02-14T16:15:55.967","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngpio: virtuser: fix UAF in configfs release path\n\nThe gpio-virtuser configfs release path uses guard(mutex) to protect\nthe device structure.

The io-uring\nhelpers instead set PF_USER_WORKER and this needed to be added as well.\n\nBut checking the flags is still not enough. There's a very small window\nwhen a task exits that it frees its mm field and it is set back to NULL.\nIf perf were to trigger at this moment, the flags test would say its a\nuser space task but when perf would read the mm field it would crash with\nat NULL pointer dereference.\n\nNow there are flags that can be used to test if a task is exiting, but\nthey are set in areas that perf may still want to profile the user space\ntask (to see where it exited). The only real test is to check both the\nflags and the mm field.\n\nInstead of making this modification in every location, create a new\nis_user_task() helper function that does all the tests needed to know if\nit is safe to read the user space memory or not.\n\n[1] https:\/\/lore.kernel.org\/all\/20250425204120.639530125@goodmis.org\/"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/5aac392fcd3d981d7997f1a0766829e1afdeac2e","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/76ed27608f7dd235b727ebbb12163438c2fbb617","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/a28fce0365e1cb9cb8c04c893b9334e5ca9d9f1c","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/d84a4836dc246b7dc244e46a08ff992956b68db0","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2026-23160","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2026-02-14T16:15:56.177","lastModified":"2026-02-14T16:15:56.177","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nocteon_ep: Fix memory leak in octep_device_setup()\n\nIn octep_device_setup(), if octep_ctrl_net_init() fails, the function\nreturns directly without unmapping the mapped resources and freeing the\nallocated configuration memory.\n\nFix this by jumping to the unsupported_dev label, which performs the\nnecessary cleanup.

It uses xa_cmpxchg_irq to erase the swap entry, but it\ngets the entry order before that using xa_get_order without lock\nprotection, and it may get an outdated order value if the entry is split\nor changed in other ways after the xa_get_order and before the\nxa_cmpxchg_irq.\n\nAnd besides, the order could grow and be larger than expected, and cause\ntruncation to erase data beyond the end border.  For example, if the\ntarget entry and following entries are swapped in or freed, then a large\nfolio was added in place and swapped out, using the same entry, the\nxa_cmpxchg_irq will still succeed, it's very unlikely to happen though.\n\nTo fix that, open code the Xarray cmpxchg and put the order retrieval and\nvalue checking in the same critical section.

from virtual_ncidev_close() when syzbot close()d\nan fd of virtual_ncidev.\n\nThe problem is that nci_unregister_device() destroys nci_dev.cmd_wq\nfirst and then calls nfc_unregister_device(), which removes the\ndevice from rfkill by rfkill_unregister().\n\nSo, the device is still visible via rfkill even after nci_dev.cmd_wq\nis destroyed.\n\nLet's unregister the device from rfkill first in nci_unregister_device().\n\nNote that we cannot call nfc_unregister_device() before\nnci_close_device() because\n\n  1) nfc_unregister_device() calls device_del() which frees\n     all memory allocated by devm_kzalloc() and linked to\n     ndev->conn_info_list\n\n  2) nci_rx_work() could try to queue nci_conn_info to\n     ndev->conn_info_list which could be leaked\n\nThus, nfc_unregister_device() is split into two functions so we\ncan remove rfkill interfaces only before nci_close_device().\n\n[0]:\nDEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(1)\nWARNING: kernel\/locking\/lockdep.c:238 at

The sending of ACPI netlink messages from\nacpi_power_meter_notify() is serialized by the new lock too which\ngenerally helps to ensure that the order of handling firmware\nnotifications is the same as the order of sending netlink messages\nrelated to them.\n\nIn addition, notice that hwmon_device_register_with_info() may fail\nin which case resource->hwmon_dev will become an error pointer,\nso add checks to avoid attempting to unregister the hwmon device\npointer to by it in that case to acpi_power_meter_notify() and\nacpi_power_meter_remove()."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/615901b57b7ef8eb655f71358f7e956e42bcd16b","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/8860ddf0e07be37169d4ef9f2618e39fca934a66","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2026-23187","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2026-02-14T17:15:56.490","lastModified":"2026-02-14T17:15:56.490","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npmdomain: imx8m-blk-ctrl: fix out-of-range access of bc->domains\n\nFix out-of-range access of bc->domains in imx8m_blk_ctrl_remove()."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/071159ff5c0bf2e5efff79501e23faf3775cbcd1","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/4390dcdabb5fca4647bf56a5a6b050bbdfa5760f","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/6bd8b4a92a901fae1a422e6f914801063c345e8d","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/7842b5dfcac888ece025a2321257d74b2264b099","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/eb54ce033b344b531b374496e68a2554b2b56b5a","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2026-23188","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2026-02-14T17:15:56.600","lastModified":"2026-02-14T17:15:56.600","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: usb: r8152: fix resume reset deadlock\n\nrtl8152 can trigger device reset during reset which\npotentially can result in a deadlock:\n\n **** DPM device timeout after 10 seconds; 15 seconds until panic ****\n Call Trace:\n <TASK>\n schedule+0x483\/0x1370\n schedule_preempt_disabled+0x15\/0x30\n __mutex_lock_common+0x1fd\/0x470\n __rtl8152_set_mac_address+0x80\/0x1f0\n dev_set_mac_address+0x7f\/0x150\n rtl8152_post_reset+0x72\/0x150\n usb_reset_device+0x1d0\/0x220\n rtl8152_resume+0x99\/0xc0\n usb_resume_interface+0x3e\/0xc0\n usb_resume_both+0x104\/0x150\n usb_resume+0x22\/0x110\n\nThe problem is that rtl8152 resume calls reset under\ntp->control mutex while reset basically re-enters rtl8152\nand attempts to acquire the same tp->control lock once\nagain.\n\nReset INACCESSIBLE device outside of tp->control mutex\nscope to avoid recursive mutex_lock() deadlock."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/1b2efc593dca99d8e8e6f6d6c7ccd9a972679702","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/61c8091b7937f91f9bc0b7f6b578de270fe35dc7","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/6d06bc83a5ae8777a5f7a81c32dd75b8d9b2fe04","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2026-23189","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2026-02-14T17:15:56.703","lastModified":"2026-02-14T17:15:56.703","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nceph: fix NULL pointer dereference in ceph_mds_auth_match()\n\nThe CephFS kernel client has regression starting from 6.18-rc1.\nWe have issue in ceph_mds_auth_match() if fs_name == NULL:\n\n    const char fs_name = mdsc->fsc->mount_options->mds_namespace;\n    ...\n    if (auth->match.fs_name && strcmp(auth->match.fs_name, fs_name)) {\n            \/ fsname mismatch, try next one *\/\n            return 0;\n    }\n\nPatrick Donnelly suggested that: In summary, we should definitely start\ndecoding `fs_name` from the MDSMap and do strict authorizations checks\nagainst it.

Instead, to\nhandle a concurrent routing update, verify that the irqfd is still active\nbefore consuming the routing information.  As evidenced by the x86 and\narm64 bugs, and another bug in kvm_arch_update_irqfd_routing() (see below),\nclobbering the entry type without notifying arch code is surprising and\nerror prone.\n\nAs a bonus, checking that the irqfd is active provides a convenient\nlocation for documenting _why_ KVM must not consume the routing entry for\nan irqfd that is in the process of being deassigned: once the irqfd is\ndeleted from the list (which happens *before* the eventfd is detached), it\nwill no longer receive updates via kvm_irq_routing_update(), and so KVM\ncould deliver an event using stale routing information (relative to\nKVM_SET_GSI_ROUTING returning to userspace).\n\nAs an even better bonus, explicitly checking for the irqfd being active\nfixes a similar bug to the one the clobbering is trying to prevent: if an\nirqfd is deactivated, and then its routing is changed,\nkvm_irq_routing_update() won't invoke kvm_arch_update_irqfd_routing()\n(because the irqfd isn't in the list).  And so if the irqfd is in bypass\nmode, IRQs will continue to be posted using the old routing information.\n\nAs for kvm_arch_irq_bypass_del_producer(), clobbering the routing type\nresults in KVM incorrectly keeping the IRQ in bypass mode, which is\nespecially problematic on AMD as KVM tracks IRQs that are being posted to\na vCPU in a list whose lifetime is tied to the irqfd.\n\nWithout the help of KASAN to detect use-after-free, the most common\nsympton on AMD is a NULL pointer deref in amd_iommu_update_ga() due to\nthe memory for irqfd structure being re-allocated and zeroed, resulting\nin irqfd->irq_bypass_data being NULL when read by\navic_update_iommu_vcpu_affinity():\n\n  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000018\n  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n  #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\n  PGD 40cf2b9067 P4D 40cf2b9067 PUD 408362a067 PMD 0\n  Oops: Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP\n  CPU: 6 UID: 0 PID: 40383 Comm: vfio_irq_test\n  Tainted: G     U  W  O        6.19.0-smp--5dddc257e6b2-irqfd #31 NONE\n  Tainted: [U]=USER, [W]=WARN, [O]=OOT_MODULE\n  Hardware name: Google, Inc.

[0]\n\nCommit f72514b3c569 (\"ipv6: clear RA flags when adding a static\nroute\") introduced logic to clear RTF_ADDRCONF from existing routes\nwhen a static route with the same nexthop is added. However, this\ncauses a problem when the existing route has a gateway.\n\nWhen RTF_ADDRCONF is cleared from a route that has a gateway, that\nroute becomes eligible for ECMP, i.e. rt6_qualify_for_ecmp() returns\ntrue. The issue is that this route was never added to the\nfib6_siblings list.\n\nThis leads to a mismatch between the following counts:\n\n- The sibling count computed by iterating fib6_next chain, which\n  includes the newly ECMP-eligible route\n\n- The actual siblings in fib6_siblings list, which does not include\n  that route\n\nWhen a subsequent ECMP route is added, fib6_add_rt2node() hits\nBUG_ON(sibling->fib6_nsiblings != rt->fib6_nsiblings) because the\ncounts don't match.\n\nFix this by only clearing RTF_ADDRCONF when the existing route does\nnot have a gateway. Routes without a gateway cannot qualify for ECMP\nanyway (rt6_qualify_for_ecmp() requires fib_nh_gw_family), so clearing\nRTF_ADDRCONF on them is safe and matches the original intent of the\ncommit.\n\n[0]:\nkernel BUG at net\/ipv6\/ip6_fib.c:1217!\nOops: invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN PTI\nCPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 6010 Comm: syz.0.17 Not tainted syzkaller #0 PREEMPT(full)\nHardware name: Google Google Compute Engine\/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 10\/25\/2025\nRIP: 0010:fib6_add_rt2node+0x3433\/0x3470 net\/ipv6\/ip6_fib.c:1217\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n fib6_add+0x8da\/0x18a0 net\/ipv6\/ip6_fib.c:1532\n __ip6_ins_rt net\/ipv6\/route.c:1351 [inline]\n ip6_route_add+0xde\/0x1b0 net\/ipv6\/route.c:3946\n ipv6_route_ioctl+0x35c\/0x480 net\/ipv6\/route.c:4571\n inet6_ioctl+0x219\/0x280 net\/ipv6\/af_inet6.c:577\n sock_do_ioctl+0xdc\/0x300 net\/socket.c:1245\n sock_ioctl+0x576\/0x790 net\/socket.c:1366\n vfs_ioctl fs\/ioctl.c:51 [inline]\n __do_sys_ioctl fs\/ioctl.c:597 [inline]\n __se_sys_ioctl+0xfc\/0x170 fs\/ioctl.c:583\n do_syscall_x64 arch\/x86\/entry\/syscall_64.c:63 [inline]\n do_syscall_64+0xfa\/0xf80 arch\/x86\/entry\/syscall_64.c:94\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77\/0x7f"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/50b7c7a255858a85c4636a1e990ca04591153dca","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/b8ad2d53f706aeea833d23d45c0758398fede580","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/bbf4a17ad9ffc4e3d7ec13d73ecd59dea149ed25","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/d8143c54ceeba232dc8a13aa0afa14a44b371d93","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2026-23201","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2026-02-14T17:15:57.950","lastModified":"2026-02-14T17:15:57.950","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nceph: fix oops due to invalid pointer for kfree() in parse_longname()\n\nThis fixes a kernel oops when reading ceph snapshot directories (.snap),\nfor example by simply running `ls \/mnt\/my_ceph\/.snap`.\n\nThe variable str is guarded by __free(kfree), but advanced by one for\nskipping the initial '_' in snapshot names.
