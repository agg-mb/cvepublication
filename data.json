The most extreme edge case is that, in (D)TLS 1.3, it was possible that an unencrypted (D)TLS 1.3 record from the server containing first a ServerHello message and then the rest of the first server flight would be accepted by a wolfSSL client. In (D)TLS 1.3 the handshake is encrypted after the ServerHello but a wolfSSL client would accept an unencrypted flight from the server.

A man-in-the-middle attacker can assume a victim's identify for access to government, medical, and financial resources, and can also extract personal data from the card, aka the \"sPACE (Spoofing Password Authenticated Connection Establishment)\" issue. This occurs because of a combination of factors, such as insecure PIN entry (for basic readers) and eid:\/\/ deeplinking. The victim must be using a modified eID kernel, which may occur if the victim is tricked into installing a fake version of an official app. NOTE: the BSI position is \"ensuring a secure operational environment at the client side is an obligation of the ID card owner.\""}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/ctrlalt.medium.com\/space-attack-spoofing-eids-password-authenticated-connection-establishment-11561e5657b1","source":"cve@mitre.org"},{"url":"https:\/\/www.ausweisapp.bund.de\/","source":"cve@mitre.org"},{"url":"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/2powlii0dnmr7p7v5ijhc\/2024_German_eID_02_Spoofing_PACE_final.pdf?rlkey=nx0ffmmbq3hffgxsuqwf0f45z&dl=0","source":"cve@mitre.org"},{"url":"https:\/\/www.personalausweisportal.de\/","source":"cve@mitre.org"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2023-40093","sourceIdentifier":"security@android.com","published":"2024-02-16T02:15:49.963","lastModified":"2024-02-16T02:15:49.963","vulnStatus":"Received","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In multiple files, there is a possible way that trimmed content could be included in PDF output due to a logic error in the code.
