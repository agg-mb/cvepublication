using the druid-basic-security extension with LDAP authentication. If the underlying LDAP server is configured to allow anonymous\nbinds, an attacker can bypass authentication by providing an existing username with an empty password. This allows unauthorized access to otherwise restricted Druid resources without valid credentials.\n\nThe vulnerability stems from improper validation of LDAP authentication responses when anonymous binds are permitted, effectively treating anonymous bind success as valid user authentication. \n\nImpact\n\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker can:\n  *  Gain unauthorized access to the Apache Druid cluster\n  *  Access sensitive data stored in Druid datasources\n  *  Execute queries and potentially manipulate data\n  *  Access administrative interfaces if the bypassed account has elevated privileges\n  *  Completely compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Druid deployment                                                                                                                                                                                    \n\n\nMitigation\n \nImmediate Mitigation (No Druid Upgrade Required):                                                                                                                                                    \n  *  Disable anonymous bind on your LDAP server.

This missing validation allows an attacker to provide a public key point P from a small-order subgroup. This can lead to security issues in various situations, such as the most commonly used signature verification (ECDSA) and shared key negotiation (ECDH). When the victim computes the shared secret as S = [victim_private_key]P via ECDH, this leaks information about victim_private_key mod (small_subgroup_order). For curves with cofactor > 1, this reveals the least significant bits of the private key. When these weak public keys are used in ECDSA , it's easy to forge signatures on the small subgroup.
