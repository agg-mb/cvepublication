When the decoder finds an\ninappropriate instruction while WFE is set ENDBR, the CPU raises a #CP\nfault.\n\nFor the \"kernel IBT no ENDBR\" selftest where #CPs are deliberately\ntriggered, the WFE state of the interrupted context needs to be\ncleared to let execution continue.  Otherwise when the CPU resumes\nfrom the instruction that just caused the previous #CP, another\nmissing-ENDBRANCH #CP is raised and the CPU enters a dead loop.\n\nThis is not a problem with IDT because it doesn't preserve WFE and\nIRET doesn't set WFE.  But FRED provides space on the entry stack\n(in an expanded CS area) to save and restore the WFE state, thus the\nWFE state is no longer clobbered, so software must clear it.\n\nClear WFE to avoid dead looping in ibt_clear_fred_wfe() and the\n!ibt_fatal code path when execution is allowed to continue.\n\nClobbering WFE in any other circumstance is a security-relevant bug.\n\n[ dhansen: changelog rewording ]"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/b939f108e86b76119428a6fa4e92491e09ac7867","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/dc81e556f2a017d681251ace21bf06c126d5a192","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-56762","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-01-06T17:15:41.777","lastModified":"2025-01-07T09:15:16.973","vulnStatus":"Rejected","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"Rejected reason: This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority."}],"metrics":{},"references":[]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-56763","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-01-06T17:15:42.150","lastModified":"2025-01-06T17:15:42.150","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntracing: Prevent bad count for tracing_cpumask_write\n\nIf a large count is provided, it will trigger a warning in bitmap_parse_user.\nAlso check zero for it."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/03041e474a6a8f1bfd4b96b164bb3165c48fa1a3","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/1cca920af19df5dd91254e5ff35e68e911683706","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/3d15f4c2449558ffe83b4dba30614ef1cd6937c3","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/98feccbf32cfdde8c722bc4587aaa60ee5ac33f0","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-56764","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-01-06T17:15:42.483","lastModified":"2025-01-06T17:15:42.483","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nublk: detach gendisk from ublk device if add_disk() fails\n\nInside ublk_abort_requests(), gendisk is grabbed for aborting all\ninflight requests.
