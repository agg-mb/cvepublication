In order to\naccommodate for both situations, check that num_codecs is not zero\nbefore accessing the codecs' fields but still check for the codec's dai\nname against \"snd-soc-dummy-dai\" as needed.\n\nWhile at it, also drop the check that dai_name is not null in the mt8192\ndriver, introduced in commit 4d4e1b6319e5 (\"ASoC: mediatek: mt8192:\nCheck existence of dai_name before dereferencing\"), as it is actually\nredundant given the preceding num_codecs != 0 check."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/2f2020327cc8561d7c520d2f2d9acea84fa7b3a3","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/376f4800f34a28def026ff5c5d4fc5e54e1744ff","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/550279449ff54c5aa28cfca5c567308cbfb145f0","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-56686","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-12-28T10:15:11.827","lastModified":"2024-12-28T10:15:11.827","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\next4: fix race in buffer_head read fault injection\n\nWhen I enabled ext4 debug for fault injection testing, I encountered the\nfollowing warning:\n\n  EXT4-fs error (device sda): ext4_read_inode_bitmap:201: comm fsstress:\n         Cannot read inode bitmap - block_group = 8, inode_bitmap = 1051\n  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 511 at fs\/buffer.c:1181 mark_buffer_dirty+0x1b3\/0x1d0\n\nThe root cause of the issue lies in the improper implementation of ext4's\nbuffer_head read fault injection.

The gadget is initialized using musb_gadget_enable().\n2. Meanwhile, a packet arrives, and the RXPKTRDY flag is set, raising an\n   interrupt.\n3. If IRQs are enabled, the interrupt is handled, but musb_g_rx() finds an\n   empty queue (next_request() returns NULL). The interrupt flag has\n   already been cleared by the glue layer handler, but the RXPKTRDY flag\n   remains set.\n4. The first request is enqueued using usb_ep_queue(), leading to the call\n   of req->complete(), as shown in the call trace above.\n5. If the callback enables IRQs and another packet is waiting, step (3)\n   repeats. The request queue is empty because usb_g_giveback() removes the\n   request before invoking the callback.\n6. The endpoint remains locked up, as the interrupt triggered by hardware\n   setting the RXPKTRDY flag has been handled, but the flag itself remains\n   set.\n\nFor this scenario to occur, it is only necessary for IRQs to be enabled at\nsome point during the complete callback. This happens with the USB Ethernet\ngadget, whose rx_complete() callback calls netif_rx(). If called in the\ntask context, netif_rx() disables the bottom halves (BHs). When the BHs are\nre-enabled, IRQs are also enabled to allow soft IRQs to be processed. The\ngadget itself is initialized at module load (or at boot if built-in), but\nthe first request is enqueued when the network interface is brought up,\ntriggering rx_complete() in the task context via ioctl(). If a packet\narrives while the interface is down, it can prevent the interface from\nreceiving any further packets from the USB host.\n\nThe situation is quite complicated with many parties involved. This\nparticular issue can be resolved in several possible ways:\n\n1. Ensure that callbacks never enable IRQs. This would be difficult to\n   enforce, as discovering how netif_rx() interacts with interrupts was\n   already quite challenging and u_ether is not the only function driver.\n   Similar \"bugs\" could be hidden in other drivers as well.\n2. Disable MUSB interrupts in musb_g_giveback() before calling the callback\n   and re-enable them afterwars (by calling musb_{dis,en}able_interrupts(),\n   for example). This would ensure that MUSB interrupts are not handled\n   during the callback, even if IRQs are enabled. In fact, it would allow\n   IRQs to be enabled when releasing the lock. However, this feels like an\n   inelegant hack.\n3. Modify the interrupt handler to clear the RXPKTRDY flag if the request\n   queue is empty. While this approach also feels like a hack, it wastes\n   CPU time by attempting to handle incoming packets when the software is\n   not ready to process them.\n4. Flush the Rx FIFO instead of calling rxstate() in musb_ep_restart().\n   This ensures that the hardware can receive packets when there is at\n   least one request in the queue.

However, in certain cases,\na raw tracepoint argument may end up being NULL. More context about this\nissue is available in [0].\n\nThus, there is a discrepancy between the reality, that raw_tp arguments\ncan actually be NULL, and the verifier's knowledge, that they are never\nNULL, causing explicit NULL checks to be deleted, and accesses to such\npointers potentially crashing the kernel.\n\nTo fix this, mark raw_tp arguments as PTR_MAYBE_NULL, and then special\ncase the dereference and pointer arithmetic to permit it, and allow\npassing them into helpers\/kfuncs; these exceptions are made for raw_tp\nprograms only. Ensure that we don't do this when ref_obj_id > 0, as in\nthat case this is an acquired object and doesn't need such adjustment.\n\nThe reason we do mask_raw_tp_trusted_reg logic is because other will\nrecheck in places whether the register is a trusted_reg, and then\nconsider our register as untrusted when detecting the presence of the\nPTR_MAYBE_NULL flag.\n\nTo allow safe dereference, we enable PROBE_MEM marking when we see loads\ninto trusted pointers with PTR_MAYBE_NULL.\n\nWhile trusted raw_tp arguments can also be passed into helpers or kfuncs\nwhere such broken assumption may cause issues, a future patch set will\ntackle their case separately, as PTR_TO_BTF_ID (without PTR_TRUSTED) can\nalready be passed into helpers and causes similar problems. Thus, they\nare left alone for now.\n\nIt is possible that these checks also permit passing non-raw_tp args\nthat are trusted PTR_TO_BTF_ID with null marking. In such a case,\nallowing dereference when pointer is NULL expands allowed behavior, so\nwon't regress existing programs, and the case of passing these into\nhelpers is the same as above and will be dealt with later.\n\nAlso update the failure case in tp_btf_nullable selftest to capture the\nnew behavior, as the verifier will no longer cause an error when\ndirectly dereference a raw tracepoint argument marked as __nullable.\n\n  [0]: https:\/\/lore.kernel.org\/bpf\/ZrCZS6nisraEqehw@jlelli-thinkpadt14gen4.remote.csb"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/3634d4a310820567fc634bf8f1ee2b91378773e8","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/c9b91d2d54175f781ad2c361cb2ac2c0e29b14b6","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/cb4158ce8ec8a5bb528cc1693356a5eb8058094d","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-56703","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-12-28T10:15:18.433","lastModified":"2024-12-28T10:15:18.433","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nipv6: Fix soft lockups in fib6_select_path under high next hop churn\n\nSoft lockups have been observed on a cluster of Linux-based edge routers\nlocated in a highly dynamic environment. Using the `bird` service, these\nrouters continuously update BGP-advertised routes due to frequently\nchanging nexthop destinations, while also managing significant IPv6\ntraffic. The lockups occur during the traversal of the multipath\ncircular linked-list in the `fib6_select_path` function, particularly\nwhile iterating through the siblings in the list. The issue typically\narises when the nodes of the linked list are unexpectedly deleted\nconcurrently on a different core—indicated by their 'next' and\n'previous' elements pointing back to the node itself and their reference\ncount dropping to zero. This results in an infinite loop, leading to a\nsoft lockup that triggers a system panic via the watchdog timer.\n\nApply RCU primitives in the problematic code sections to resolve the\nissue. Where necessary, update the references to fib6_siblings to\nannotate or use the RCU APIs.\n\nInclude a test script that reproduces the issue. The script\nperiodically updates the routing table while generating a heavy load\nof outgoing IPv6 traffic through multiple iperf3 clients.
