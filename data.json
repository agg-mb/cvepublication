Instead, the change is\ndeferred until the next instance of the interrupt being triggered on the\noriginal CPU.\n\nWhen the interrupt next triggers on the original CPU, the new affinity is\nenforced within __irq_move_irq(). A vector is allocated from the new CPU,\nbut the old vector on the original CPU remains and is not immediately\nreclaimed. Instead, apicd->move_in_progress is flagged, and the reclaiming\nprocess is delayed until the next trigger of the interrupt on the new CPU.\n\nUpon the subsequent triggering of the interrupt on the new CPU,\nirq_complete_move() adds a task to the old CPU's vector_cleanup list if it\nremains online. Subsequently, the timer on the old CPU iterates over its\nvector_cleanup list, reclaiming old vectors.\n\nHowever, a rare scenario arises if the old CPU is outgoing before the\ninterrupt triggers again on the new CPU.\n\nIn that case irq_force_complete_move() is not invoked on the outgoing CPU\nto reclaim the old apicd->prev_vector because the interrupt isn't currently\naffine to the outgoing CPU, and irq_needs_fixup() returns false. Even\nthough __vector_schedule_cleanup() is later called on the new CPU, it\ndoesn't reclaim apicd->prev_vector; instead, it simply resets both\napicd->move_in_progress and apicd->prev_vector to 0.\n\nAs a result, the vector remains unreclaimed in vector_matrix, leading to a\nCPU vector leak.\n\nTo address this issue, move the invocation of irq_force_complete_move()\nbefore the irq_needs_fixup() call to reclaim apicd->prev_vector, if the\ninterrupt is currently or used to be affine to the outgoing CPU.\n\nAdditionally, reclaim the vector in __vector_schedule_cleanup() as well,\nfollowing a warning message, although theoretically it should never see\napicd->move_in_progress with apicd->prev_cpu pointing to an offline CPU."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/59f86a2908380d09cdc726461c0fbb8d8579c99f","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/6752dfcfff3ac3e16625ebd3f0ad9630900e7e76","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/9eeda3e0071a329af1eba15f4e57dc39576bb420","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/a40209d355afe4ed6d533507838c9e5cd70a76d8","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/a6c11c0a5235fb144a65e0cb2ffd360ddc1f6c32","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/e9c96d01d520498b169ce734a8ad1142bef86a30","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/ebfb16fc057a016abb46a9720a54abf0d4f6abe1","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/f5f4675960609d8c5ee95f027fbf6ce380f98372","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-33619","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-06-21T11:15:09.767","lastModified":"2024-06-21T11:22:01.687","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nefi: libstub: only free priv.runtime_map when allocated\n\npriv.runtime_map is only allocated when efi_novamap is not set.\nOtherwise, it is an uninitialized value.

I took a\nlook in the commit, but it looks fine to me. So I thought the cause is not\nin the commit diff.\n\nI found the WARN is printed when the f2fs is set up with multiple devices,\nand read requests are mapped to the very first block of the second device in the\ndirect read path. In this case, f2fs_map_blocks() and f2fs_map_blocks_cached()\nmodify map->m_pblk as the physical block address from each block device. It\nbecomes zero when it is mapped to the first block of the device. However,\nf2fs_iomap_begin() assumes that map->m_pblk is the physical block address of the\nwhole f2fs, across the all block devices. It compares map->m_pblk against\nNULL_ADDR == 0, then go into the unexpected branch and sets the invalid\niomap->length. The WARN catches the invalid iomap->length.\n\nThis WARN is printed even for non-zoned block devices, by following steps.\n\n - Create two (non-zoned) null_blk devices memory backed with 128MB size each:\n   nullb0 and nullb1.\n # mkfs.f2fs \/dev\/nullb0 -c \/dev\/nullb1\n # mount -t f2fs \/dev\/nullb0 \"${mount_dir}\"\n # dd if=\/dev\/zero of=\"${mount_dir}\/test.dat\" bs=1M count=192\n # dd if=\"${mount_dir}\/test.dat\" of=\/dev\/null bs=1M count=192 iflag=direct\n\n...\"\n\nSo, the root cause of this issue is: when multi-devices feature is on,\nf2fs_map_blocks() may return zero blkaddr in non-primary device, which is\na verified valid block address, however, f2fs_iomap_begin() treats it as\nan invalid block address, and then it triggers the warning in iomap\nframework code.\n\nFinally, as discussed, we decide to use a more simple and direct way that\nchecking (map.m_flags & F2FS_MAP_MAPPED) condition instead of\n(map.m_pblk != NULL_ADDR) to fix this issue.\n\nThanks a lot for the effort of Yi Zhang and Shinichiro Kawasaki on this\nissue.\n\n[1] https:\/\/lore.kernel.org\/linux-f2fs-devel\/CAHj4cs-kfojYC9i0G73PRkYzcxCTex=-vugRFeP40g_URGvnfQ@mail.gmail.com\/\n[2] https:\/\/lore.kernel.org\/linux-f2fs-devel\/gngdj77k4picagsfdtiaa7gpgnup6fsgwzsltx6milmhegmjff@iax2n4wvrqye\/"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/1a9225fdd0ec95fcf32936bcea9ceef0cf1512dc","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/2b2611a42462c6c685d40b5f3aedcd8d21c27065","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/33e62cd7b4c281cd737c62e5d8c4f0e602a8c5c5","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/e8b485e39b4d17afa9a2821fc778d5a67abfc03a","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-38637","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-06-21T11:15:12.400","lastModified":"2024-06-21T11:22:01.687","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ngreybus: lights: check return of get_channel_from_mode\n\nIf channel for the given node is not found we return null from\nget_channel_from_mode.
