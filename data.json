This is due to improper sanitization of the `filterText` parameter in the `ajaxUpdatePaginationLinks` AJAX action. The sanitization logic can be bypassed by using the sequence `*$\/` which becomes `*\/` after the `$` character is removed, allowing attackers to escape SQL comment contexts. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access and above, to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the database via a time-based blind SQL injection technique."}],"metrics":{"cvssMetricV31":[{"source":"security@wordfence.com","type":"Primary","cvssData":{"version":"3.1","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1\/AV:N\/AC:L\/PR:H\/UI:N\/S:U\/C:H\/I:N\/A:N","baseScore":4.9,"baseSeverity":"MEDIUM","attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","privilegesRequired":"HIGH","userInteraction":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"HIGH","integrityImpact":"NONE","availabilityImpact":"NONE"},"exploitabilityScore":1.2,"impactScore":3.6}]},"weaknesses":[{"source":"security@wordfence.com","type":"Primary","description":[{"lang":"en","value":"CWE-89"}]}],"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/plugins.trac.wordpress.org\/browser\/404-solution\/tags\/2.36.10\/includes\/DataAccess.php#L977","source":"security@wordfence.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/plugins.trac.wordpress.org\/browser\/404-solution\/tags\/2.36.10\/includes\/DataAccess.php#L987","source":"security@wordfence.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/plugins.trac.wordpress.org\/browser\/404-solution\/tags\/2.36.10\/includes\/PluginLogic.php#L1595","source":"security@wordfence.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/plugins.trac.wordpress.org\/browser\/404-solution\/tags\/2.36.10\/includes\/sql\/getRedirectsForView.sql#L106","source":"security@wordfence.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/plugins.trac.wordpress.org\/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=3417333%40404-solution&new=3417333%40404-solution&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","source":"security@wordfence.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/www.wordfence.com\/threat-intel\/vulnerabilities\/id\/389bee79-b59f-484a-86df-f041d6b00051?source=cve","source":"security@wordfence.com"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-14508","sourceIdentifier":"security@wordfence.com","published":"2025-12-13T16:16:50.953","lastModified":"2025-12-13T16:16:50.953","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"The MediaCommander – Bring Folders to Media, Posts, and Pages plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized data deletion due to a missing capability check on the import-csv REST API endpoint in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.1.
