However these pages are\nbeyond i_size, thus writeback code generally ignores these dirty pages\nand no blocks were ever actually zeroed on the disk.\n\nThis oversight was fixed by commit 693c241a5f6a (\"ocfs2: No need to zero\npages past i_size.\") for standard ocfs2 write path, inline conversion\npath was apparently forgotten; the commit log also has a reasoning why\nthe zeroing actually is not needed.\n\nAfter commit 6dbf7bb55598, things became worse as writeback code stopped\ninvalidating buffers on pages beyond i_size and thus these pages end up\nwith clean PageDirty bit but with buffers attached to these pages being\nstill dirty.  So when a file is converted from inline format, then\nwriteback triggers, and then the file is grown so that these pages\nbecome valid, the invalid dirtiness state is preserved,\nmark_buffer_dirty() does nothing on these pages (buffers are already\ndirty) but page is never written back because it is clean.

The old code\nallocated a stack frame on the emergency stack, but didn't use the\nframe to store anything, and also didn't store anything in its caller's\nframe.\n\nidle_kvm_start_guest() on the other hand is written more like a normal C\nfunction, it creates a frame on entry, and also stores CR\/LR into its\ncallers frame (per the ABI). The problem is that there is no caller\nframe on the emergency stack.\n\nThe emergency stack for a given CPU is allocated with:\n\n  paca_ptrs[i]->emergency_sp = alloc_stack(limit, i) + THREAD_SIZE;\n\nSo emergency_sp actually points to the first address above the emergency\nstack allocation for a given CPU, we must not store above it without\nfirst decrementing it to create a frame. This is different to the\nregular kernel stack, paca->kstack, which is initialised to point at an\ninitial frame that is ready to use.\n\nidle_kvm_start_guest() stores the backchain, CR and LR all of which\nwrite outside the allocation for the emergency stack. It then creates a\nstack frame and saves the non-volatile registers. Unfortunately the\nframe it creates is not large enough to fit the non-volatiles, and so\nthe saving of the non-volatile registers also writes outside the\nemergency stack allocation.\n\nThe end result is that we corrupt whatever is at 0-24 bytes, and 112-248\nbytes above the emergency stack allocation.\n\nIn practice this has gone unnoticed because the memory immediately above\nthe emergency stack happens to be used for other stack allocations,\neither another CPUs mc_emergency_sp or an IRQ stack. See the order of\ncalls to irqstack_early_init() and emergency_stack_init().\n\nThe low addresses of another stack are the top of that stack, and so are\nonly used if that stack is under extreme pressue, which essentially\nnever happens in practice - and if it did there's a high likelyhood we'd\ncrash due to that stack overflowing.\n\nStill, we shouldn't be corrupting someone else's stack, and it is purely\nluck that we aren't corrupting something else.\n\nTo fix it we save CR\/LR into the caller's frame using the existing r1 on\nentry, we then create a SWITCH_FRAME_SIZE frame (which has space for\npt_regs) on the emergency stack with the backchain pointing to the\nexisting stack, and then finally we switch to the new frame on the\nemergency stack."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/6d077c37c4643394b1bae9682da48164fc147ea8","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/80bbb0bc3a0288442f7fe6fc514f4ee1cb06ccb7","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/9b4416c5095c20e110c82ae602c254099b83b72f","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/fbd724c49bead048ae9fc1a5b7bff2fb3e54f855","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2021-47466","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-05-22T07:15:11.450","lastModified":"2024-05-22T12:46:53.887","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm, slub: fix potential memoryleak in kmem_cache_open()\n\nIn error path, the random_seq of slub cache might be leaked.
