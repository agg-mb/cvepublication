a quiescent state in code that is not\nexplicitly calling into the scheduler.\n\nThis race leads to use-after-free of a \"struct pid\".\nIt is probably somewhat hard to hit because process A has to pass\nthrough a synchronize_rcu() operation while process B is between\nmutex_unlock() and get_pid().\n\nFix it by ensuring that by the time a pointer to the current task's pid\nis stored in the file,
