The transmitted packet will contain the wrong data from the\n   iovec pages.\n\nThis has not been an issue with SDMA packets from hfi1 Verbs or PSM2\nbecause they only produce iovecs that end short of PAGE_SIZE as the tail\niovec of an SDMA request.\n\nFixing these bugs exposes other bugs with the SDMA pin cache\n(struct mmu_rb_handler) that get in way of supporting user SDMA requests\nwith multiple payload iovecs whose buffers do not end at PAGE_SIZE. So\nthis commit fixes those issues as well.\n\nHere are the mmu_rb_handler bugs that non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec\npayload user SDMA requests can hit:\n1. Overlapping memory ranges in mmu_rb_handler will result in duplicate\n   pinnings.\n2. When extending an existing mmu_rb_handler entry (struct mmu_rb_node),\n   the mmu_rb code (1) removes the existing entry under a lock, (2)\n   releases that lock, pins the new pages, (3) then reacquires the lock\n   to insert the extended mmu_rb_node.\n\n   If someone else comes in and inserts an overlapping entry between (2)\n   and (3), insert in (3) will fail.\n\n   The failure path code in this case unpins _all_ pages in either the\n   original mmu_rb_node or the new mmu_rb_node that was inserted between\n   (2) and (3).\n3. In hfi1_mmu_rb_remove_unless_exact(), mmu_rb_node->refcount is\n   incremented outside of mmu_rb_handler->lock. As a result, mmu_rb_node\n   could be evicted by another thread that gets mmu_rb_handler->lock and\n   checks mmu_rb_node->refcount before mmu_rb_node->refcount is\n   incremented.\n4. Related to #2 above, SDMA request submission failure path does not\n   check mmu_rb_node->refcount before freeing mmu_rb_node object.\n\n   If there are other SDMA requests in progress whose iovecs have\n   pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb_node(s), those pointers to the\n   now-freed mmu_rb nodes will be dereferenced when those SDMA requests\n   complete."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/00cbce5cbf88459cd1aa1d60d0f1df15477df127","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/7e6010f79b58f45b204cf18aa58f4b73c3f30adc","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/9c4c6512d7330b743c4ffd18bd999a86ca26db0d","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/a2bd706ab63509793b5cd5065e685b7ef5cba678","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/c76cb8f4bdf26d04cfa5485a93ce297dba5e6a80","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/dce59b5443700fbd0d2433ec6e4d4cf063448844","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-25768","sourceIdentifier":"cve@mitre.org","published":"2024-02-26T18:15:07.757","lastModified":"2024-02-26T22:10:40.463","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"OpenDMARC 1.4.2 contains a null pointer dereference vulnerability in \/OpenDMARC\/libopendmarc\/opendmarc_policy.c."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/LuMingYinDetect\/OpenDMARC_defects\/blob\/main\/OpenDMARC_detect_1.md","source":"cve@mitre.org"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-25770","sourceIdentifier":"cve@mitre.org","published":"2024-02-26T18:15:07.810","lastModified":"2024-02-26T22:10:40.463","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"libming 0.4.8 contains a memory leak vulnerability in \/libming\/src\/actioncompiler\/listaction.c."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/LuMingYinDetect\/libming_defects\/blob\/main\/libming_detect_1.md","source":"cve@mitre.org"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-26455","sourceIdentifier":"cve@mitre.org","published":"2024-02-26T18:15:07.863","lastModified":"2024-02-26T22:10:40.463","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"fluent-bit 2.2.2 contains a Use-After-Free vulnerability in \/fluent-bit\/plugins\/custom_calyptia\/calyptia.c."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/LuMingYinDetect\/fluent-bit_defects\/blob\/main\/fluent-bit_detect_1.md","source":"cve@mitre.org"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-27084","sourceIdentifier":"security-advisories@github.com","published":"2024-02-26T18:15:07.920","lastModified":"2024-02-26T18:15:07.920","vulnStatus":"Rejected","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"Rejected reason: This CVE is a duplicate of CVE-2024-1631."}],"metrics":{},"references":[]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-1899","sourceIdentifier":"vulnreport@tenable.com","published":"2024-02-26T19:15:07.037","lastModified":"2024-02-26T22:10:40.463","vulnStatus":"Awaiting Analysis","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"An issue in the anchors subparser of Showdownjs versions <= 2.1.0 could allow a remote attacker to cause denial of service conditions.\n"}],"metrics":{"cvssMetricV31":[{"source":"vulnreport@tenable.com","type":"Secondary","cvssData":{"version":"3.1","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1\/AV:N\/AC:L\/PR:N\/UI:N\/S:U\/C:N\/I:N\/A:L","attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","privilegesRequired":"NONE","userInteraction":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"NONE","integrityImpact":"NONE","availabilityImpact":"LOW","baseScore":5.3,"baseSeverity":"MEDIUM"},"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.4}]},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/www.tenable.com\/security\/research\/tra-2024-05","source":"vulnreport@tenable.com"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2024-24528","sourceIdentifier":"cve@mitre.org","published":"2024-02-26T19:15:07.247","lastModified":"2024-02-26T19:15:07.247","vulnStatus":"Rejected","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"Rejected reason: DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER.
