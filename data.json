In the current Meshtastic architecture, a Node is identified by their NodeID, generated from the MAC address, rather than their public key. This aspect downgrades the security, specifically by abusing the HAM mode which doesn't use encryption. An attacker can, as such, forge a NodeInfo on behalf of a victim node advertising that the HAM mode is enabled. This, in turn, will allow the other nodes on the mesh to accept the new information and overwriting the NodeDB. The other nodes will then only be able to send direct messages to the victim by using the shared channel key instead of the PKC. Additionally, because HAM mode by design doesn't provide any confidentiality or authentication of information, the attacker could potentially also be able to change the Node details, like the full name, short code, etc. To keep the attack persistent, it is enough to regularly resend the forged NodeInfo, in particular right after the victim sends their own.

Versions prior to 0.8.26 have a sandbox escape vulnerability due to `AsyncFunction` not being isolated in `SandboxFunction`. The library attempts to sandbox code execution by replacing the global `Function` constructor with a safe, sandboxed version (`SandboxFunction`). This is handled in `utils.ts` by mapping `Function` to `sandboxFunction` within a map used for lookups. However, before version 0.8.26, the library did not include mappings for `AsyncFunction`, `GeneratorFunction`, and `AsyncGeneratorFunction`. These constructors are not global properties but can be accessed via the `.constructor` property of an instance (e.g., `(async () => {}).constructor`). In `executor.ts`, property access is handled. When code running inside the sandbox accesses `.constructor` on an async function (which the sandbox allows creating), the `executor` retrieves the property value. Since `AsyncFunction` was not in the safe-replacement map, the `executor` returns the actual native host `AsyncFunction` constructor. Constructors for functions in JavaScript (like `Function`, `AsyncFunction`) create functions that execute in the global scope. By obtaining the host `AsyncFunction` constructor, an attacker can create a new async function that executes entirely outside the sandbox context, bypassing all restrictions and gaining full access to the host environment (Remote Code Execution).

By supplying a specially crafted rev value (for example, `rev=--output=\/tmp\/poc.txt)`, an attacker can inject git show command-line options. When OpenProject executes the SCM command, Git interprets the attacker-controlled rev as an option and writes the output to an attacker-chosen path. As a result, any user with the `:browse_repository` permission on the project can create or overwrite arbitrary files that the OpenProject process user is permitted to write. The written contents consist of git show output (commit metadata and patch), but overwriting application or configuration files still leads to data loss and denial of service, impacting integrity and availability.

Prior to versions 5.4.51, 6.4.33, 7.3.11, 7.4.5, and 8.0.5, the Symfony Process component did not correctly treat some characters (notably `=`) as “special” when escaping arguments on Windows. When PHP is executed from an MSYS2-based environment (e.g. Git Bash) and Symfony Process spawns native Windows executables, MSYS2’s argument\/path conversion can mis-handle unquoted arguments containing these characters. This can cause the spawned process to receive corrupted\/truncated arguments compared to what Symfony intended. If an application (or tooling such as Composer scripts) uses Symfony Process to invoke file-management commands (e.g. `rmdir`, `del`, etc.) with a path argument containing `=`, the MSYS2 conversion layer may alter the argument at runtime. In affected setups this can result in operations being performed on an unintended path, up to and including deletion of the contents of a broader directory or drive. The issue is particularly relevant when untrusted input can influence process arguments (directly or indirectly, e.g. via repository paths, extracted archive paths, temporary directories, or user-controlled configuration). Versions 5.4.51, 6.4.33, 7.3.11, 7.4.5, and 8.0.5 contains a patch for the issue. Some workarounds are available. Avoid running PHP\/one's own tooling from MSYS2-based shells on Windows; prefer cmd.exe or PowerShell for workflows that spawn native executables. Avoid passing paths containing `=` (and similar MSYS2-sensitive characters) to Symfony Process when operating under Git Bash\/MSYS2. Where applicable, configure MSYS2 to disable or restrict argument conversion (e.g. via `MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL`), understanding this may affect other tooling behavior."}],"metrics":{"cvssMetricV31":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","cvssData":{"version":"3.1","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1\/AV:L\/AC:H\/PR:N\/UI:R\/S:U\/C:N\/I:H\/A:H","baseScore":6.3,"baseSeverity":"MEDIUM","attackVector":"LOCAL","attackComplexity":"HIGH","privilegesRequired":"NONE","userInteraction":"REQUIRED","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"NONE","integrityImpact":"HIGH","availabilityImpact":"HIGH"},"exploitabilityScore":1.0,"impactScore":5.2}]},"weaknesses":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary","description":[{"lang":"en","value":"CWE-88"}]}],"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/symfony\/symfony\/commit\/35203939050e5abd3caf2202113b00cab5d379b3","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/symfony\/symfony\/commit\/ec154f6f95f8c60f831998ec4d246a857e9d179b","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/symfony\/symfony\/issues\/62921","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/symfony\/symfony\/pull\/63164","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/symfony\/symfony\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-r39x-jcww-82v6","source":"security-advisories@github.com"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2026-24742","sourceIdentifier":"security-advisories@github.com","published":"2026-01-28T21:16:11.913","lastModified":"2026-01-28T21:16:11.913","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"Discourse is an open source discussion platform.

Arithmetic overflow can be triggered in the `Bytes::slice`, `Vec::slice`, and `Prng::gen_range` (for `u64`) methods in the `soroban-sdk` in versions up to and including `25.0.1`, `23.5.1`, and `25.0.2`. Contracts that pass user-controlled or computed range bounds to `Bytes::slice`, `Vec::slice`, or `Prng::gen_range` may silently operate on incorrect data ranges or generate random numbers from an unintended range, potentially resulting in corrupted contract state. Note that the best practice when using the `soroban-sdk` and building Soroban contracts is to always enable `overflow-checks = true`. The `stellar contract init` tool that prepares the boiler plate for a Soroban contract, as well as all examples and docs, encourage the use of configuring `overflow-checks = true` on `release` profiles so that these arithmetic operations fail rather than silently wrap. Contracts are only impacted if they use `overflow-checks = false` either explicitly or implicitly. It is anticipated the majority of contracts could not be impacted because the best practice encouraged by tooling is to enable `overflow-checks`. The fix available in `25.0.1`, `23.5.1`, and `25.0.2` replaces bare arithmetic with `checked_add` \/ `checked_sub`, ensuring overflow traps regardless of the `overflow-checks` profile setting. As a workaround, contract workspaces can be configured with a profile available in the GitHub Securtity Advisory to enable overflow checks on the arithmetic operations. This is the best practice when developing Soroban contracts, and the default if using the contract boilerplate generated using `stellar contract init`. Alternatively, contracts can validate range bounds before passing them to `slice` or `gen_range` to ensure the conversions cannot overflow."}],"metrics":{"cvssMetricV31":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","cvssData":{"version":"3.1","vectorString":"CVSS:3.1\/AV:N\/AC:L\/PR:N\/UI:N\/S:U\/C:N\/I:L\/A:N","baseScore":5.3,"baseSeverity":"MEDIUM","attackVector":"NETWORK","attackComplexity":"LOW","privilegesRequired":"NONE","userInteraction":"NONE","scope":"UNCHANGED","confidentialityImpact":"NONE","integrityImpact":"LOW","availabilityImpact":"NONE"},"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.4}]},"weaknesses":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary","description":[{"lang":"en","value":"CWE-190"}]}],"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/stellar\/rs-soroban-sdk\/commit\/3890521426d71bb4d892b21f5a283a1e836cfa38","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/stellar\/rs-soroban-sdk\/commit\/59fcef437260ed4da42d1efb357137a5c166c02e","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/stellar\/rs-soroban-sdk\/commit\/c2757c6d774dbb28b34a0b77ffe282e59f0f8462","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/stellar\/rs-soroban-sdk\/pull\/1703","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/stellar\/rs-soroban-sdk\/releases\/tag\/v22.0.9","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/stellar\/rs-soroban-sdk\/releases\/tag\/v23.5.1","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/stellar\/rs-soroban-sdk\/releases\/tag\/v25.0.2","source":"security-advisories@github.com"},{"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/stellar\/rs-soroban-sdk\/security\/advisories\/GHSA-96xm-fv9w-pf3f","source":"security-advisories@github.com"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2026-1548","sourceIdentifier":"cna@vuldb.com","published":"2026-01-28T23:15:50.670","lastModified":"2026-01-28T23:15:50.670","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"A flaw has been found in Totolink A7000R 4.1cu.4154.
