It discovers that\nthe refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus\nproceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may\nreturn an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since\nthe target page->mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting\nPAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.\n\nThere are seveval ways to fix this issue:\n(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving\n'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target\npage has not built mappings yet.\n(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing\nthe system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()\nwithout holding the page lock, such as compaction.\n(3) Using target page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits\npage state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove\nthe page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way.\n\nSo I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential\nissues for PFN walkers, such as compaction."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/3889a418b6eb9a1113fb989aaadecf2f64964767","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/9128bfbc5c80d8f4874dd0a0424d1f5fb010df1b","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/d1adb25df7111de83b64655a80b5a135adbded61","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2023-52491","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2024-03-11T18:15:16.807","lastModified":"2024-03-11T18:15:16.807","vulnStatus":"Received","descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmedia: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to error path handling in mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run\n\nIn mtk_jpeg_probe, &jpeg->job_timeout_work is bound with\nmtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work.\n\nIn mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run, if error happens in\nmtk_jpeg_set_dec_dst, it will finally start the worker while\nmark the job as finished by invoking v4l2_m2m_job_finish.\n\nThere are two methods to trigger the bug.

mostly due to above use-after-free\n\n[CAUSE]\nThe converted fs has the following data chunk layout:\n\n    item 2 key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 2214658048) itemoff 16025 itemsize 80\n        length 86016 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|single\n\nFor above logical bytenr 2214744064, it's at the chunk end\n(2214658048 + 86016 = 2214744064).\n\nThis means btrfs_submit_bio() would split the bio, and trigger endio\nfunction for both of the two halves.\n\nHowever scrub_submit_initial_read() would only expect the endio function\nto be called once, not any more.\nThis means the first endio function would already free the bbio::bio,\nleaving the bvec freed, thus the 2nd endio call would lead to\nuse-after-free.\n\n[FIX]\n- Make sure scrub_read_endio() only updates bits in its range\n  Since we may read less than 64K at the end of the chunk, we should not\n  touch the bits beyond chunk boundary.\n\n- Make sure scrub_submit_initial_read() only to read the chunk range\n  This is done by calculating the real number of sectors we need to\n  read, and add sector-by-sector to the bio.\n\nThankfully the scrub read repair path won't need extra fixes:\n\n- scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read()\n  With above fixes, we won't update error bit for range beyond chunk,\n  thus scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read() should never submit any read\n  beyond the

The purpose of the function is to update\nthe guest's AP configuration by filtering the matrix of adapters and\ndomains assigned to the mdev. When an adapter or domain is assigned, only\nthe APQNs associated with the APID of the new adapter or APQI of the new\ndomain are inspected.
