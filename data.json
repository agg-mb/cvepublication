If this\ncall fails, a fallback routine attempts to obtain the IAD from the next\ninterface and sets a BADD profile. However, snd_usb_mixer_controls_badd()\nassumes that the IAD retrieved from usb_ifnum_to_if() is always valid,\nwithout performing a NULL check. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference when usb_ifnum_to_if() fails to find the interface descriptor.\n\nThis patch adds a NULL pointer check after calling usb_ifnum_to_if() in\nsnd_usb_mixer_controls_badd() to prevent the dereference.\n\nThis issue was discovered by syzkaller, which triggered the bug by sending\na crafted USB device descriptor."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/23aea9c74aeea2625aaf4fbcc6beb9d09e30f9e4","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/2762d3ea9c929ca4094541ca517c317ffa94625b","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/57f607c112966c21240c424b33e2cb71e121dcf0","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/632108ec072ad64c8c83db6e16a7efee29ebfb74","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/85568535893600024d7d8794f4f8b6428b521e0c","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/9f282104627be5fbded3102ff9004f753c55a063","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/c5c08965ab96b16361e69a1e2a0e89dbcb99b5a6","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/cbdbfc756f2990942138ed0138da9303b4dbf9ff","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-40276","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-12-06T22:15:55.433","lastModified":"2025-12-06T22:15:55.433","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm\/panthor: Flush shmem writes before mapping buffers CPU-uncached\n\nThe shmem layer zeroes out the new pages using cached mappings, and if\nwe don't CPU-flush we might leave dirty cachelines behind, leading to\npotential data leaks and\/or asynchronous buffer corruption when dirty\ncachelines are evicted."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/576c930e5e7dcb937648490611a83f1bf0171048","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/7a12f9c96d06b145562f76ffb20369b4692f0911","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-40277","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-12-06T22:15:55.560","lastModified":"2025-12-06T22:15:55.560","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm\/vmwgfx: Validate command header size against SVGA_CMD_MAX_DATASIZE\n\nThis data originates from userspace and is used in buffer offset\ncalculations which could potentially overflow causing an out-of-bounds\naccess."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/32b415a9dc2c212e809b7ebc2b14bc3fbda2b9af","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/54d458b244893e47bda52ec3943fdfbc8d7d068b","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/5aea2cde03d4247cdcf53f9ab7d0747c9dca1cfc","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/709e5c088f9c99a5cf2c1d1c6ce58f2cca7ab173","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/a3abb54c27b2c393c44362399777ad2f6e1ff17e","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/b5df9e06eed3df6a4f5c6f8453013b0cabb927b4","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/e58559845021c3bad5e094219378b869157fad53","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/f3f3a8eb3f0ba799fae057091d8c67cca12d6fa0","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2025-40278","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-12-06T22:15:55.700","lastModified":"2025-12-06T22:15:55.700","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: sched: act_ife: initialize struct tc_ife to fix KMSAN kernel-infoleak\n\nFix a KMSAN kernel-infoleak detected  by the syzbot .\n\n[net?] KMSAN: kernel-infoleak in __skb_datagram_iter\n\nIn tcf_ife_dump(), the variable 'opt' was partially initialized using a\ndesignatied initializer.

The root\ncause is not that the `struct ttm_resource_manager *man` pointer itself is NULL,\nbut that `man->bdev` (the backing device pointer within the manager) remains\nuninitialized (NULL) on APUs—since APUs lack dedicated VRAM and do not fully\nset up VRAM manager structures. When `ttm_resource_manager_usage()` attempts to\nacquire `man->bdev->lru_lock`, it dereferences the NULL `man->bdev`, leading to\na kernel OOPS.\n\n1. **amdgpu_cs.c**: Extend the existing bandwidth control check in\n   `amdgpu_cs_get_threshold_for_moves()` to include a check for\n   `ttm_resource_manager_used()`. If the manager is not used (uninitialized\n   `bdev`), return 0 for migration thresholds immediately—skipping VRAM-specific\n   logic that would trigger the NULL dereference.\n\n2. **amdgpu_kms.c**: Update the `AMDGPU_INFO_VRAM_USAGE` ioctl and memory info\n   reporting to use a conditional: if the manager is used, return the real VRAM\n   usage; otherwise, return 0.
