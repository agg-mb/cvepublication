As a result, ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream() allocates skb\nwith uninitialized memory and ath9k_htc_rx_msg() is reading from\nuninitialized memory.\n\nSince bytes accessed by ath9k_htc_rx_msg() is not known until\nath9k_htc_rx_msg() is called, it would be difficult to check minimal valid\npkt_len at \"if (pkt_len > 2 * MAX_RX_BUF_SIZE) {\" line in\nath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().\n\nWe have two choices. One is to workaround by adding __GFP_ZERO so that\nath9k_htc_rx_msg() sees 0 if pkt_len is invalid. The other is to let\nath9k_htc_rx_msg() validate pkt_len before accessing. This patch chose\nthe latter.\n\nNote that I'm not sure threshold condition is correct, for I can't find\ndetails on possible packet length used by this protocol."}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/0d2649b288b7b9484e3d4380c0d6c4720a17e473","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/2c485f4f2a64258acc5228e78ffb828c68d9e770","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/4891a50f5ed8bfcb8f2a4b816b0676f398687783","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/84242f15f911f34aec9b22f99d1e9bff19723dbe","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/9661724f6206bd606ecf13acada676a9975d230b","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/b1b4144508adfc585e43856b31baaf9008a3beb4","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/b383e8abed41cc6ff1a3b34de75df9397fa4878c","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/f3d2a3b7e290d0bdbddfcee5a6c3d922e2b7e02a","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2022-50710","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-12-24T11:15:51.180","lastModified":"2025-12-24T11:15:51.180","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: set tx_tstamps when creating new Tx rings via ethtool\n\nWhen the user changes the number of queues via ethtool, the driver\nallocates new rings.

Such\n  case breaks the current affinity logic which is based on\n  group_cpus_evenly() who assumes the number of CPUs are not less than\n  the number of groups. This can trigger a warning[1]:\n\n\tif (ret >= 0)\n\t\tWARN_ON(nr_present + nr_others < numgrps);\n\nFixing this by only build the affinity masks only when\n\n- Driver passes affinity descriptor, driver like virtio-blk can make\n  sure to limit the number of queues when it exceeds the number of CPUs\n- Parent support affinity setting config ops\n\nThis help to avoid the warning. More optimizations could be done on\ntop.\n\n[1]\n[  682.146655] WARNING: CPU: 6 PID: 1550 at lib\/group_cpus.c:400 group_cpus_evenly+0x1aa\/0x1c0\n[  682.146668] CPU: 6 PID: 1550 Comm: vdpa Not tainted 6.5.0-rc5jason+ #79\n[  682.146671] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.2-0-gea1b7a073390-prebuilt.qemu.org 04\/01\/2014\n[  682.146673] RIP: 0010:group_cpus_evenly+0x1aa\/0x1c0\n[  682.146676] Code: 4c 89 e0 5b 5d 41 5c 41 5d 41 5e c3 cc cc cc cc e8 1b c4 74 ff 48 89 ef e8 13 ac 98 ff 4c 89 e7 45 31 e4 e8 08 ac 98 ff eb c2 <0f> 0b eb b6 e8 fd 05 c3 00 45 31 e4 eb e5 cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc\n[  682.146679] RSP: 0018:ffffc9000215f498 EFLAGS: 00010293\n[  682.146682] RAX: 000000000001f1e0 RBX: 0000000000000041 RCX: 0000000000000000\n[  682.146684] RDX: ffff888109922058 RSI: 0000000000000041 RDI: 0000000000000030\n[  682.146686] RBP: ffff888109922058 R08: ffffc9000215f498 R09: ffffc9000215f4a0\n[  682.146687] R10: 00000000000198d0 R11: 0000000000000030 R12: ffff888107e02800\n[  682.146689] R13: 0000000000000030 R14: 0000000000000030 R15: 0000000000000041\n[  682.146692] FS:  00007fef52315740(0000) GS:ffff888237380000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n[  682.146695] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n[  682.146696] CR2: 00007fef52509000 CR3: 0000000110dbc004 CR4: 0000000000370ee0\n[  682.146698] DR0: 0000000000000000 DR1: 0000000000000000 DR2: 0000000000000000\n[  682.146700] DR3: 0000000000000000 DR6: 00000000fffe0ff0 DR7: 0000000000000400\n[  682.146701] Call Trace:\n[  682.146703]  <TASK>\n[  682.146705]  ? __warn+0x7b\/0x130\n[  682.146709]  ? group_cpus_evenly+0x1aa\/0x1c0\n[  682.146712]  ? report_bug+0x1c8\/0x1e0\n[  682.146717]  ? handle_bug+0x3c\/0x70\n[  682.146721]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x14\/0x70\n[  682.146723]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16\/0x20\n[  682.146727]  ? group_cpus_evenly+0x1aa\/0x1c0\n[  682.146729]  ? group_cpus_evenly+0x15c\/0x1c0\n[  682.146731]  create_affinity_masks+0xaf\/0x1a0\n[  682.146735]  virtio_vdpa_find_vqs+0x83\/0x1d0\n[  682.146738]  ? __pfx_default_calc_sets+0x10\/0x10\n[  682.146742]  virtnet_find_vqs+0x1f0\/0x370\n[  682.146747]  virtnet_probe+0x501\/0xcd0\n[  682.146749]  ? vp_modern_get_status+0x12\/0x20\n[  682.146751]  ? get_cap_addr.isra.0+0x10\/0xc0\n[  682.146754]  virtio_dev_probe+0x1af\/0x260\n[  682.146759]  really_probe+0x1a5\/0x410"}],"metrics":{},"references":[{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/5f2592243ccd5bb5341f59be409ccfdd586841f3","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/628b53fc66ca1910a3cb53c3c7e44e59750c3668","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"},{"url":"https:\/\/git.kernel.org\/stable\/c\/ae15aceaa98ad9499763923f7890e345d9f46b60","source":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67"}]}},{"cve":{"id":"CVE-2023-54009","sourceIdentifier":"416baaa9-dc9f-4396-8d5f-8c081fb06d67","published":"2025-12-24T11:15:53.857","lastModified":"2025-12-24T11:15:53.857","vulnStatus":"Received","cveTags":[],"descriptions":[{"lang":"en","value":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni2c: cadence: cdns_i2c_master_xfer(): Fix runtime PM leak on error path\n\nThe cdns_i2c_master_xfer() function gets a runtime PM reference when the\nfunction is entered.

The busy bluetooth\ntraffic generates lots of C2H (card to host) messages, which are not\nfreed correctly.\n\nTo fix this, move the dev_kfree_skb() call in rtl8xxxu_c2hcmd_callback()\ninside the loop where skb_dequeue() is called.\n\nThe RTL8192EU leaks memory because the C2H messages are added to the\nqueue and left there forever.

I have observed\na number of systems in this exact state, but am currently unable to\nreproduce it.\n\nRather than leaving this footgun lying around for the future, take\nadvantage of the fact that there is room in the struct anyway, and that\nit is already quite large and simply change the three bitfield members to\nbools.

This could happen if the\nrecord was reported to already exist in the\nbtrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_nolock() call, but then there was an error\nlater on add_delayed_ref_head(). In this case, since\nadd_delayed_ref_head() returned an error, the caller went to free the\nrecord. Since add_delayed_ref_head() couldn't set this kfree'd pointer\nto NULL, then kfree() would have acted on a non-NULL 'record' object\nwhich was pointing to memory already freed by the callee.\n\nThe problem comes from the fact that the responsibility to kfree the\nobject is on both the caller and the callee at the same time. Hence, the\nfix for this is to shift the ownership of the 'qrecord' object out of\nthe add_delayed_ref_head(). That is, we will never attempt to kfree()\nthe given object inside of this function, and will expect the caller to\nact on the 'qrecord' object on its own. The only exception where the\n'qrecord' object cannot be kfree'd is if it was inserted into the\ntracing logic, for which we already have the 'qrecord_inserted_ret'\nboolean to account for this. Hence, the caller has to kfree the object\nonly if add_delayed_ref_head() reports not to have inserted it on the\ntracing logic.\n\nAs a side-effect of the above, we must guarantee that\n'qrecord_inserted_ret' is properly initialized at the start of the\nfunction, not at the end, and then set when an actual insert\nhappens.
